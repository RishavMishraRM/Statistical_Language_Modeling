580,Hello all - I am so glad I found this discussion board!

653,"I posted and asked a few days ago if anyone had feelings on whether it was better to go with IR ( interventional radiology)  and have the procedure done under twilight or  wait for the surgeon in an OR under general ... well I picked IR ... surgery wasn't unplesant and  not  too bad for sedation either. Now I did have a small issue of passing out after I was released and a trip via rapid resonse to the ER.... I was feeling fine and had eaten and had a drink  they released me and i took the wheelchair ride to wait for my sis to get the car.  As I waited my BP dropped to 85/58 and I got sweaty neuseous etc etc and about passed out so to the ER I went. They called it a vaso-vagal reaction.  after thye released me 4 hours later I went home with instructions to leave the Tegaderm on for 14 hours then shower  since the glue and steri strips below would stay on  til they came off on their opwn.. The MINUTE I took the Tegaderm off I KNEW I had a bad infection,and that I got it during surgery. Cellulitis .  So I went to a closer ( same  hospital group  ) interventional radiation  and they prescribed oral meds. Took them and within an HOUR OR TWO I  could see the infection making a red line along a vein !!!!( PHLEBITIS!!) .... so I went to the ER!!! They confirmed yes, bad scene---- skin  infection cellulitis and phelbitits too,  and started me on IV vancomycin..... and minutes later I had RED MAN SYNDROME... so they stopped the vanco and we waited and switched to CINDAMYCIN..... I have been admitted to the hospital and in since FRIDAY with IV meds... awaiting culture results..... so not sure I recommend IR ... stick with surgeon in OR :(    Now they are talking about removing the port and AGAIN a chemo delay ... I am getting worried :("

762,"Anyone been to one of these?  There's one in Sacramento Sept 8-9 and I'm torn. They're supposed to be really good, are free, but it's the whole weekend (you can attend one day only).  Would like some feedeback before I commit."
779, I needed to see my dentist last Friday.  I had pain and needed to get checked out.  She found an abscessed tooth and also noticed a lump on my tongue.  She refers me to an oral surgeon.  
810,"Well, I lost about half my hair today. It came out as I brushed it. My hair is three feet long so it left quite a pile on the floor. I asked my daughter to come tomorrow and shave my head. O my God. That's if any more comes out tomorrow. I know, denial, right? My head feels strange, like it's sunburned. I don't think I will get a wig, it's not really my thing. I may change my mind. My daughter had the idea to sew hair extensions to a do-rag so I can wear that under a hat. I think this is hilarious. If you could see me, you would know why. Most people think I am Amish, as my faith is very similar. So that's why I am traumatized about losing my hair."
911,"It has been a long haul, over a year and a half, with 7 surgeries.  Ever since my diagnosis, this cloud has come over my mind.  It has been with me, but is getting better.  Memory, decisions, just the most basic things have become difficult.  I figure it is because the mental burden of bc, all the drugs, tons of anesthesia.  But I have not had any chemo, no radiation, no hormone treatment.  I am definitely anemic, but my basic question is:"
1019,Happy Birthday!
1107,"Good morning dear pink warriors, I'm back from CO and refreshed from the wonderful mountain air.  I spent over 20 hours at the top of pikes peak on Sunday for the international hill climb, I was 13,000 feet or higher:) Now today back to reality with my feet on the ground and heading to my second dose of Doxil:( I hate going to chemo but keep hoping this just might be the one. Almost every time I have chemo, I'm alone and it makes me sad, I feel like my family/friends are tired of it/me:( tomorrow will be three years that I've been fighting and I can't blame them if they're tired of it/me, because I sure am.
Sorry about that little vent, what I wanted to know is if anyone else is or has had Doxil?  It's really hard on me days 7-10, and I'm wanting to quit taking it. I'm hoping someone ot there has some experience with it, please let me know how you do with it.

1542,"When I was going through the terror and heartbreak of my cancer, I was encouraged by stories of brave women who survived and thrived. I am 11 years from the day I heard my doctor say ""you have a lump"" and the start of new pages to my life history. Today I am surrounded by the love of my family and friends and offer hope to all who are traveling this road."
1585,"Wish me luck today!  Hopefully I will be able to continue my Chemo treatments today!  Had to cancel 3/25 and 4/1 treatment dates due to Radiation Recall.  I had Mammosite (internal radiation) first and then started Chemo.  The Chemo always finds the weakest link in your body!  It's like a bad sunburn that peels and leaves skin raw.  They treated me with triple antibotic cream and Silvadene.  It's better and I hope it's a go today.  It's discouraging when you have to delay treatments because you make plans and have to cancel them!  Just want to get on with life!  Tired of being tired!  Just a little down today!  I know I have to be positive, Right!"
1588,"Dawne had her first treatment of the gemzar yesterday. She was very sick last night and said she felt like she had the flu. That was pretty much what they told her to expect. She is not on steroids with this chemo and is very happy about that.Her lymphadema is giving her trouble, she is hoping not taking the steroids will help that. She is having some pain at the cancer site. She was not having any nausea today and was relieved! She will take treatment 2 Wednesdays in a row then off 1. Thank you all again for the prayers, love and support for Dawne. God Bless you all"
1671,"Just came from the cardiologist.  My muga scan came out in normal range.  Yet he still wants me to do a stress test, and he put me on some little pill everyday.  2.5 milligrams.  not sure what it is.  Now he wants me to do a stress test!   I AM SO PISSED.  I HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT ALL MY LIFE, NEVER HAD HIGH CHOLESTEROL COUNTS.  I WORK OUT 3- 5 TIMES A WEEK, AND I AM AN FITNESS INSTRUCTOR. "

1836,"I am 44 and have been getting regular ultrasound follow-ups for a fibroadenoma left breast on the diagnonal from the armpit to the nipple. I went to a high risk breast facility and they said it is a classic fibroadenoma meaning the ultrasound features were classic and revealed no clues that it might not be a fibroadenoma. It is the shape and size of a slightly larger vitamin E capsule. Ove three years it has not grown at all so they said no need to biopsy. I asked well when do you biopsy and they said if it appeared suddenly. To me it did but I also was working out and lost some weight and developed my pec muscles so I thought maybe it was there all along. What is more disconcerting to me is that below this adenoma, there is a larger, smooth area that feels about 2 cm wide by 1.5 cm high but thinner like 1 /2 an inch. No one can feel it. There is similar feeling tissue in the other breast but much smaller and it seems less large after my period. The doctor said that it is connective tissue that is fibrous hence the term fibrocystic that is common around an adenoma. It has not gotten any larger, but I feel it move against my rib cage, meaning it is not fixed. Now no one can find it on ultrasound. I am thinking of having the adenoma (sm one) removed but my doctor says they don't do that if it is stable and not growing. My gyno who said it was a fibroadenoma now says it could be a phyllodes. I told my breast doc and he said no that is so rare. QUESTION: do phyllodes tumors always grow ? or do they stabilize at 2-3"". Whatever I have has not grown over three years. Obviously, I need to go to a facility that has more experience w phyllodes like John hopkins and if anyone else knows a good facility in the NE- I am in New York, that would be great. Since no one can feel the area that I feel below the adenoma and near the rib cage nor can they find it on ultra sound then maybe I need an MRI. I appreciate if any one has information to share about their experience of symtoms and getting diagnosed because that is the stage that I am at. Did you get diagnosed w an MRI, US, etc. could you feel it, how did it feel? Where do these tend to be located in the breast? deep in the breast? Did you do just a core biopsy or is full excision the way to go? I read that this type of tumor if malignant bypasses the lymph nodes and goes straight through the circulatory system. The doc did a lymph exam and said the lymph nodes felf normal. Thanks for reading this and to anyone who takes the time to answer. Thank-you for sharing and best of luck to everyone. "

2270,Nine days ago I finished my chemo.  4 rounds of A/C and 12 of Taxol.  I expected to start feeling better since I didn't have chemo this week but I feel so weak.  My legs feel like lead and I can only do a little and have to sit down and rest.  Can some of you ladies weigh in on how long after chemo did you begin to physically feel better.  I'm getting sort of down over this.

Sorry to drop this bad news on you, but need all prayers and positive thoughts to fight off this new beast."
2452,"I really need to ask some questions. My daughter is  12 and when she  started to develop breasts I started to notice 1 lump almost the size of her boob, but in both of them. Since there was one in both I thought it was normal. But I asked my friend about it, and she said her daughter  didn't have a lump in the middle of her breast, and she's more developed then mine daughter, so I started to think about breast cancer, but can girls of this  age get it? And having one lump in both of your breasts normal?????"
2492,"Hi, I have stage four breast cancer and am waiting to hear about a new brain tumor. My husband has stayed with me for 6 years thru this ordeal. Tonight he made me so mad! He said he is worried that when I die his life will be HORRIBLE and he will have no life. I asked him what he meant and he said he wouldn't have my income. This isn't true my family would help the children and him. I don't know how to react to this statement.

2670,"8 years out with Ned and hoping to stay that way. But I'll tell you, I have had somthing hit me. Started 1st week of February, sore , red throat...some drainage, no big deal as I've had that before. By the end of the 3rd week with no relief in sight, went to the CVS ""Minute clinic"" where I saw a nurse practitioner. Gave me a strep test since I was concerned being around my grandkids (whom I probably caught this from), and that came out negative. She put me on Nasonex, Claritin and a decongestant. Oh my goodness, for the next 3 weeks, contant drainage which gave me a sinus infection. Went back to her and she prescribed antibiotics. I had fever for a week! Both times, checked my lungs and was clear. But since then, wicked cough. Stubborn and violent. Some wheezing. I'm going to the real doctor tomorrow to try and get to the bottom of this. Coughing up phlem so I'm thinking bronchitis but we'll see. I really felt good today and was out enjoying the almost 80 degree weather but had to retreat to the car with the worst coughing attack as of yet!"
2794,"Just joined today. I had a lumpectomy with removal of 2 sentinel lymph nodes, left breast, 8 days ago, which was 6 weeks after having rotator cuff repair surgery on the shoulder on the same side. My lymph nodes came back negative and pathology report showed margins were clear. However, because it was invasive ductal carcinoma my medical oncologist is going to run an Oncotype test to see whether I'm a low, intermediate or high risk patient. Low risk = no chemo, high risk=chemo, intermediate= we'll discuss it. So Arimidex and radiation are on hold while I wait the 2 weeks for the results. "

2907,"I had a lumpectony and am currently in radiation.  When I finish radiation treatments, my oncologist wants me to try Tamoxifen.  I really don't want to inre to all of the side effects it has given to a lot of women, let alone blood clots and uterine cancer.  The Tamoxifen will only lower my percentage of a recurrence by 6%.  I, personally, don't think that for a 6% benefit, that it is worth it.  What do you think?  I still have time to decide.  I am just trying to educate myself on this subject.  Thanks! "

I'm doing ok today, yesterday was hard, but today is a new day:) My daughter is coming out at noon and my social worker, and hospice nurse will be here at 1 to introduce themselves and get me started. I'm sure I've made the right decision for me, but I'm still a little scared. I will keep you all updated as I learn new things.

3240,"I am now 2 weeks post-lumpectomy, and my pain level is the worst it has been, and not controlled by meds. Yesterday, my surgeon drained off over 10 cc of fluid from my breast, hoping to give me some relief. However, improvement was negligible. She'll be draining off more tomorrow, but if she can't give me relief is talking about having me back in surgery on Friday."
3254,"I posted on FB last week was my 5 yrs since diagnosis & surgery-friend called and said wow 5 yrs it doesn't seem like that long. Then saidI don't think of you having cancer. (YOU were so matter of fact, just went through radiation etc) I think since you had radiation-with others they have gone through so much more. I think my comment on FB was UNTIL YOU go through it five years is NO biggie..to ME MILE STONE...as most know here each year is great moment. JUST in Nov i had another lumpectomy , same side , thinkning it was cancer again and it was NOT..only scar tissue.."

3508,I was given 9 treatments of Herceptin before my heart infraction rate went too low to continue.  I was taken off for three months to see if my rate would go up.  I had two mugascans during this time.  My heart infraction ratio did improve but not to the normal rate.  My oncologist said I cannot finish the last 8 Herceptin treatments due to my heart not returning to normal function.

5946,"Hello. I am 43 years old. This is the first time I've posted on this.  I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the right breast in October 2007.  I have had 2 surgeries to remove the cancerous tissue.  The first surgery removed the micro-calcifications found on the Mammograms.  They thought they got clear margins, but the Oncologist wanted ""wider"" clear margins.  I then had numerous magnified, digital mammograms, a breast MRI, a bone scan, a chest xray, and a MUGA scan of the heart.  Nothing showed up on any of these scans.  But, the Oncologist wanted a ""wider"" clear margin and wanted the lymph nodes taken out.  I then had a central lumpectomy and they removed 2 Sentinel Nodes and 13 lymph nodes."
5949,"The FDA just approved the new treatment for about 20% of breast cancer patients who have a particular form of the disease that overproduces the protein HER-2.The drug now called Kadcyla, combines the Herceptin with a powerful chemotherapy toxin and a third chemical linking the medicines together. The chemical keeps the drugs intact until they bind to a cancer cell, where the medication is released.The cost of the drug is about $9,800 a month or $94,000 for a typical course of treatment. It is about twice the price of Herceptin itself and similar to the price of some other new cancer drugs.The label of Kadcyla has a warning saying the drug can cause liver toxicity, heart toxicity and death. It can also cause serious birth defects or fetal death for women of childbearing age.http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm340704.htmThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today approved ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla, Genentech), also known as T-DM1, for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.T-DM1 is indicated for patients who were previously treated with the anti-HER2 therapy trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech) and a taxane chemotherapy.This product offers a new twist on an older product; it is an antibody–drug conjugate in which the HER2-targeted antibody trastuzumab is chemically linked to the cytotoxin mertansine (DM1). The antibody homes in on HER2 breast cancer cells, delivering the chemotherapy directly to the tumor, which reduces the risk for toxicity.T-DM1 ""delivers the drug to the cancer site to shrink the tumor, slow disease progression, and prolong survival,"" said Richard Pazdur, MD, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products at the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a press statement. ""It is the fourth approved drug that targets the HER2 protein.""In the pivotal phase 3 EMILIA study, patients receiving T-DM1 survived nearly 6 months longer than patients receiving the standard therapy of lapatinib (Tykerb) plus capecitabine (Xeloda) (median overall survival, 30.9 vs 25.1 months). Also, there were fewer grade 3 or higher (severe) adverse events with TDM-1 than with standard therapy (43.1% vs. 59.2%), according to the company.The approval represents a ""momentous"" day in breast cancer, said Kathy Miller, MD, from Indiana University in Indianapolis, in her Miller on Oncology Medscape blog.""Our HER2-positive patients with metastatic disease have another very powerful therapy that offers the real hope for prolonged disease control with less toxicity,"" she said.""This is the classic light-beer scenario; it's less filling and tastes great,"" she summarized, adding that T-DM1 was more effective in EMILIA than standard therapy on every outcome: overall response rate, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival.However, another expert sees T-DM1 in a less dramatic light.Steve Vogl, MD, a private practitioner and former academic who practices in the Bronx, New York, called T-DM1 a ""nice"" drug when he discussed the product in an online essay last year.T-DM1 causes ""no alopecia, little neutropenia, and only moderate thrombocytopenia. It requires only a short infusion every 3 weeks, lacks cumulative toxicity, and has a response rate as first-line chemotherapy that is about the same as that of docetaxel and trastuzumab, with apparently longer remissions,"" he wrote.However, Dr. Vogl called the EMILIA control regimen (lapatinib and capecitabine) ""distinctly suboptimal"" and not a standard of care, even though it is an FDA-approved treatment option in this setting.""TDM-1 does not meet [the] goals of a major advance,"" wrote Dr. Vogl, who explained that such an advance must cure some patients, increase the rate of clinical complete remission, or produce a high rate of very long partial response.TDM-1 does not provide a ""major change in prognosis"" for women with metastatic disease who have progressed on trastuzumab treatment, he wrote, adding that it is likely to be ""very expensive.""Study Data and Boxed WarningThe international open-label EMILIA study involved 991 patients with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer who had previously been treated with trastuzumab and a taxane chemotherapy. The study met the coprimary efficacy end points of overall survival and progression-free survival (assessed by an independent review committee).Median progression-free survival was longer with TDM-1 than with lapatinib plus capecitabine (9.6 vs 6.4 months). In addition, patients treated with TDM-1 lived significantly longer without their disease getting worse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; reduction in risk of disease worsening or death, 35%; P < .0001).The risk of dying was 32% lower with TDM-1 than with lapatinib and capecitabine (HR, 0.68; P = .0006).For patients receiving TDM-1, the most common adverse events (occurring in more than 2% of participants) of grade 3 or higher were low platelet count (14.5%), increased levels of enzymes released by the liver and other organs (8%), low red blood cell count (4.1%), low levels of potassium in the blood (2.7%), nerve problems (2.2%), and tiredness (2.5%).T-DM1 was reviewed under the FDA's priority review program, which provides for an expedited 6-month review of drugs that might provide safe and effective therapy when no satisfactory alternative exists, or that offer significant improvement over comparable products on the market.T-DM1 is being approved with a boxed warning that alerts patients and healthcare professionals that the drug can cause liver toxicity, heart toxicity, and death. The drug can also cause severe life-threatening birth defects, so pregnancy status should be verified prior to starting T-DM1 treatment.Dr. Vogl has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Dr. Miller reports financial ties with Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca, Roche, and Clovis Oncology.Citation: FDA Approves New Treatment for Metastatic HER2 Breast Cancer. Medscape.

6010,"I just wanted to update y'all on Dawne. She is hanging in there. She has chemo every other Monday. It is rough on her but she is fighting hard. Her faith holds her strong. She will be having a PET scan on the 30th so please keep her in your prayers. Her younger sister (early 30's) was dx about 6 wks ago with stage 3 cervical cancer. It has been hard on Dawne because her sister lives in another state,she would love to be with her. She will have chemo and rads starting the 22nd, please keep her in your prayers too."
6027,"Well Dawne got the results of the PET yesterday. It was not what we had wanted to hear. The cancer between her lungs has grown again. Her last scan had shown it getting a little smaller but, it had grown this time. The good new is that it has NOT spread anywhere else. That is good!! She does have gall stones, and the Dr can see something on her liver. She will be having the gall bladder removed probably at some point but I am not sure on when. This is what I know for now. Dawne is still ready to fight!! We all know how tired she has to be but she is ready for battle! Please keep her and her family in your prayers. I will post again when I have more to share. Dawne thinks of you all often and lifts you in prayer. God Bless"
6030,"Dawne had her first treatment of the gemzar yesterday. She was very sick last night and said she felt like she had the flu. That was pretty much what they told her to expect. She is not on steroids with this chemo and is very happy about that.Her lymphadema is giving her trouble, she is hoping not taking the steroids will help that. She is having some pain at the cancer site. She was not having any nausea today and was relieved! She will take treatment 2 Wednesdays in a row then off 1. Thank you all again for the prayers, love and support for Dawne. God Bless you all"

6127,Happy Birthday Dear Carol -- Hoping you have a wonderful Day celebrating your very special day
6136,"It has been a little over 2 months since all treatment was stopped. When the doctor was pushing hospice and said my mobility would be going fast, I was determined, no way. He told me to travel asap if there were any trips I wanted to take. Then I got vertigo, some meds and went to CA for 5 days, other than being dizzy it wasnt too bad. Figured I would go to Sacramento when the temp dropped some. Fast track 2 months this week from the trip to CA. I decided on a hospice. I am walking with a cane. Still going but any walking is quite painful. It is the right leg from the calf to the hip on to the spine, and the left ribs, mainly in the back. I saw endocrinologist last monday, even 50k iu of vit d, not absorbing. Vit B12 is non existant, and I am once again hypothyroid. I have been on meds for the thyroid for almost 6 yrs. It was removed in 2009 with tumors with abnormal cells. So now upping synthroid. I am taking the 50k iu of vit D 1x a week and 5k daily, magnesium, and I am back on weekly shots of vit b12. My body is not absorbing. I am now using a cane as my right leg goes out.n I have been spending time with my brother and his wife, my ex and my boys. We have been fishing. It takes a bit to get to my spot, but I get there. and my ex has been grocery shopping with me, running errands, etc, and my boys are doing almost too much for me, even putting the worm on my hook! lol I am still going strong, just at a slower pace, and less often. But still not willing to stop. I cant tell you all how much I hate cancer. I feel like it is taking more of me every day. Hugs, Carol"
6278,I have been praying for you every day and was wondering if you are checking the site.  I was never blessed with a daughter but if I had a daughter I would have wanted her to be just like you.  You are like no other.  Hugs sweetie.  Your pink moms will keep the prayers coming for our cyber daughter.
6293,my surgery is coming up in a week.  I don't know what to expect in terms of pain level post-op (having double mastectomy).  I know I'll get pain meds but hate taking pills.  Is the pain level significant and how long does it last?
6328,"I saw my oncologist Tuesday to go over the results of the PET scan. My day actually started with a very urgent sounding lady from the lab insisting I get a hold of my provider immediately. Evidently she didn't realize this was blood work ordered by my oncologist as it seems my tumor markers were way elevated. (7. something)
I had been concerned about a muscle spasm in my right back and hoped it wouldn't light up like Times Square on the scan. I'd had this problem since early April and I thought it was from my new keyboard.
After getting the results yesterday I now know what I'm facing and it's not good. Evidently I have 2 spots on my spine (T2 and T9) as well as mets to the 12th rib. So the pain wasn't a muscle spasm at all but bone mets.
I was to have my port installed yesterday morning but the imaging machine at the hospital went on the fritz and I've still heard nothing about rescheduling.
I will be starting 6 rounds of CMF (Cytoxan, Methotrexate and Fluorouracil) probably next week. Not sure what the prognosis is for the bone mets but I've heard not so good.
Anyone else dealt with this?

6355,"Hi, I was diagnosed with early stages of breast cancer in May 1997, I was 31 years old. Had a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, no chemo or radiation. In May 2000, I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. There was another lump on my reconstructed breast and I had 30 out of 35 lymph nodes under my arm positive for cancer. I had 8 treatments of the strongest chemo they could give me and 6 weeks of radiation. In May 2001, I was diagnosed again with metastatic breast cancer and this time it is in the brain. I have had 10 treatments of radiation to the head. I had quite a few tumors. They will do another MRI on my head around July 3. I have had CT scans to the chest, abdomen, and pelvic and there are no signs of cancer there. I am going to have a bone scan soon. I asked my onocologist did it usually go somewhere else before it went to the brain. She said that she had seen it go to the brain with people that tested positive for the Her2 protein. Has anyone out there had this happen to them? I would appreciate any information anyone could give me. Thanks, Nelda"

6415,Happy Birthday!!!!
6416,Here is what Kari posted today on the shout out to her:
6428,happy birthday wishes my dear friend .. Enjoy your day 
6432,"My beautiful 43 year old wife of 4 years was recently diagnosed with Stage 2A breast cancer in her right breast. She has two lumps (1cm&1.5 cm) and one lymph node under the arm came back positive for non Her2 50% estrogen receptive very agressive BC. All MRIs and bone scans came back negative for cancer any where other than in the right breast (great news). She was started on 4 treatment of AC bi-weekly then will get 4 of taxol bi-weekly, then surgery. Surgeon hopes the chemo will shrink the tumors enough to only do a lumpectomy. She got her 2nd AC treatment last friday and has been doing great, just a little tired the day after and sore bones due to the neulasta injection. She is handling it much better than me. I try to stay strong and positive for her but sometimes I just break down and feel there is no hope. She has started loosing her hair and asked me to shave it off for her tonight. It breaks my heart and don't think that I can do it. I went to buy her some warm hats today at Wal-Mart and just broke down and had to leave the store. I am so scared of losing her and I don't know how to stop the ""worst case scenario"" thinking.
  I also don't understand why the doctors decided to do chemo first instead of just cutting the tumors and lymph node out? Will the chemo work ? I feel so lost and helpless when I see the fear in her eyes and there is nothing that I can do about it. She lost her mother to breast cancer when she(my wife) was 17 years old and sees herself in her mothers shoes. Any help or advice on how to handle this would be wonderful. Thank you all so much "
6546,"I've had it with chemo!  A little over a month ago I decided to stop taking chemo treatments.  It was way too much for me.  My husband and I researched and researched for alternative methods and found tons of info on it. We found a documentary about the Rick Simpson story called ""Run From The Cure"".  We decided to try this but didn't know anyone who is a care giver in our small town.  We had gone to a birthday party for my little niece at my brothers house and started talking about what we want to do.  A couple that we didn't know was there and heard us talking.  They are care givers for medical marijuana and I became a patient of theirs. I took meeting these people as a sign from God to try this method!!  Being off chemo and on cannabis now for about 4 weeks, I have been feeling better and better.  If you watch the video...(I will post the link)...you will see how they make the oil.  Actually my caregiver thought that I would do better on raw cannabis rather than oil because I really don't want any kind of a ""high"".  The raw cannabis does not get me high at all.  I can work all day a feel great. I take the oil at night to help me sleep.  I've always had that problem.  I am so happy to feel good for a change.  I know cannabis has a big stigma on it....but please keep an open mind and research for yourself.  You can contact me any time and I would love to discuss this with you.  There are thousands of cancer patients that have been cured of cancer with cannabis!!  No side effects!!  Here is the link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0psJhQHk_GI.  Take care girls and God bless!"
6649,"I had a lumpectomy this past April and had three lymph nodes taken out. The lymph nodes were fine. The cancerous lump was around 1"" in size and was a triple positive. After a bunch of research and a divine encounter I said NO to radiation and NO to chemo. The doctors wanted me to do chemo for 12 rounds. I started seeing a Naturopath and a Nutrionist. The Naturopath told me that every woman she was treating was deficient in Vitamin D and for me to get that level checked. Turns out I too was Vit D deficient. A lack of Vit D has been linked to cancer including increasing the risk of aggressive cancers. Being deficient in Iodine and Vit E is also linked to breast cancers. In addition to checking my vitamins and minerals I started to eat a more vegetable diet and stayed away from foods that would contribute to the positive proteins. "
6802,"First off, thanks to everyone who posts here.  We have drawn so much inspiration from this site.  "
6820,"My oncologist said fatigue will get progressively easier by the day but after 8 days still kind of wasted!   Tummy pains, metal mouth and queasy still I can deal with.    I am new to chemo (first infusion).  Don't want to sit around like a lump but really hard to get moving and disappointed in myself!     I really look forward to going to bed, taking a nap and just sitting.  My head still a bit foggy too "
6923,"The reason i ask i got mine checked in December and it was 63 the oncologist nurse said that was good it  had to be between 30 and 100 i dont know,my oncologist nurse is an air head i think. i called and ask for a refill on my meds which are Exemestane substituted  for aromasin well she didn't hav a clue of what i was talking about,i thought she should have aleast knew what i was talking about duh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!thank God im not doing chemo now with her around, i just go in for blood work.~~MollyZ~~"
6988,On Monday I had my 3rd mammo since my dx and treatment. I am very happy to report that the news came back all clear. I am still dancing with NED!
7067,I have been told and have seen it on alot of websites that cancer cells feeds off sugar. I ask my ONC this and he said that this has actually really not been proven yet so I could occasionally have a desert. I also read that cancer cells also feeds off of all artifical sweetners. I hate drinking water and I know I have to go off my diet drinks. I hate lemon in my water. Also you have to watch your carbs because these turns into sugar also. Does anybody have any suggestions for helping me drink more water. When I did drink water I would use the different flavoring packets and liked them. They have artifical sweetners in them too. Any suggestions anyone? Thanks.  Donna
7389,The following was posted by Eileen on Sunday:
7428,"She was admitted with the same symptoms as before,  headache, blurred vision in one eye, low blood pressure and now a low heart rate.  The eye doctor on call at the hospital ran some tests and said that her optic disc is swollen and the blood is not circulating like it should.  He also said she had another eye stroke. They are going to do a ct scan on her tonight and some other testing tomorrow. "

7569,"Not to be outdone by Eileen (Cypress Cynthia), I'm posting a picture of my new wig.  Yep, I've gone blonde.  This is about the color I colored my hair when I used to color it.  Several years ago I let it go gray and I thought I was happy with gray hair, so I've been buying gray wigs.   I don't think I'll ever go back to gray (or at least until I change my mind).  And I can be gray, red, brown, black, or blonde with the blink of an eye.  Not so bad. "
7598,"So Ive been reading and posting a bit to this board for about a week now, trying to adjust to my new life of a cancer person. Ughh, still seems so sad and unreal for me."
7680,"Hello everyone and hope all is well for you!  I have been going through quite the struggle with all of this. I will breifly fill everyone in on me... I have Graves Disease, Lyme Disease and now Breast Cancer. My life has been filled with battle after battle but I remain positive and l hopeful. During all of this, I have been told by many drs. and friends / family, all of the things that I NEED to do as in, Stop eating certain foods, no gluten (for the Lyme) no sugar (lyme and cancer), and then no smoking. I do not have any other type of addictions, ie) drinking , drugs,,, but I do like my occasional cigarette with my coffee, (it's something that I enjoy to do). I have been so stressed out with my whole lifestyle change and feel like a ""rebellious teen"" lol, when I am told to not do something, it makes me want to do it even more. I'm 41yrs. old and have 2 children. I do not want to feel like everything is being taken away from me all at once.. I will be having a dbl. mastectomy (no date set yet) with delayed reconstruction using the enhancers . My plastic surgeon told me that, I NEED to quit smoking and if I don't he will ""walk away"". I will have the mastectomy, but he will not finish with the enhancers if I have even a trace of nicotine show up on the ""test"" he is going to do on me! My husband smokes, and the dr said that I have to leave the room or place that he is in also if I want to have my reconstruction. I feel so frustrated! I have been doing everything to try to cut down, and quit! Its a struggle and I have cheated pretty much everyday... I'm so scared that he is going to leave me high and dry on something that is part of me and how I will view myself daily, I was wondering if anyone else had their Plastic Surgeons refuse their surgery? What kind of nicotine tests are used? I have been through 5 eye surgeries for Graves Eye Disease and smoked through each surgery. I did not have necrosis from any of these surgeries. I know smoking is bad,,, but to be refused surgery because of it ,,, I feel is so unfair. Thanks for listening! Pam"
7710,"Yesterday, I had a Stereotactic Core Needle Biopsy - OUCH! I had a mammogram which looked suspicious, right breast only. My doctor had me go for additional mammography images and an ultrasound of my right breast. The Mammogram impression was an architectural distortion corresponding with a malignant appearing mass. Category 5-malignant features, biopsy recommended. The Ultrasound impression was a 1.2cm mass at 10 o'clock and 1.4cm mass at 11 o'clock. Category 5-malignant features, biopsy recommended. Needless to say, I made an appointment with my surgeon. The surgeon requested that I bring the films and reports from radiology with me. I did. That was yesterday morning 9:00 AM. My surgeon scheduled me immediately, the same day, for 12:30 PM to do a Stereotactic Core Needle Biopsy. To say the least, I was taken back by his urgency to do this procedure. Nonetheless, I agreed. However, I did ask for something to relax me, I was nervous. He assured me that I did not need anything, because it was relatively painless. He said I wouldn't feel a thing. I insisted, he agreed and gave me 5mg of valium 1 hour prior to the biopsy. OUCH, OUCH, OUCH! I had a terrible experience. I felt everything! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy! I am so happy that it is over. Although, I am extremely anxious about waiting until Friday (3 Days) for the results to come back from pathology. Can anyone share their experience with this procedure as I have described it? Can anyone tell me why the majority of women do not have this awful pain, yet others do? Was it my surgeon? Or perhaps the location or depth of my masses? I truly don't believe my Dr. is to blame. But, why so much pain?   "
7720,"I am from the colorectal board, I came to you over a year ago to ask questions for my sister-in-law who had become stage IV with breast cancer, she was diagnosed with breast cancer 20 years ago, and with reoccurance almost two years ago that was diagnosed as the Stage IV. She lived a good life, three or so years ago she married the love of her life though too short and she spent her last years and days happy with him by her side.  She passed away this morning."
7746,"I saw a comment on yahoo.com under the big storm article. Someone mentioned to not forget the pets. I know people are important, but so are pets. I wonder if there are places willing to take pets for safe keeping? And help to get them there?
I am a big animal and bird lover, fish not so much...I worry about the animals abandoned by their owners.... It breaks my heart."
7872,"Had my last round of chemo on 12/18 and just wanted to thank all my pink sister for helping me through this incredibly hard time. Without your strength, love and support I don't know how I would of made it through. You are all amazing women and I am proud to call you my sisters! I know this week ahead will be hard but I am glad to have this behind me and looking forward to celebrating Christmas with my family and friends.
Next stop 35 rounds of radiation and I will be going back to work in mid January part time.
I wish you all a wonderful holiday and a very happy and healthy New Year!"
7882,"I'm having one next week. I've been told that when I leave,I will know what the lump is. How is it different than a regular mammo? Above all, will it hurt more than the regular mammo?"
7929,"I truly believe that Chemo did me more harm than good,  with all the Chemo-brain, balance, confusion, neuropathy, lymphodema  and all the other side effect problems.  Plus IT CAME BACK! Stage 4 exactly 5 years and 4 months after initial dx.  I honestly feel that my quality of life would have been so much better without Chemo,,,,It has really screwed me up and I as now stage 4!  What is the point?   What WAS the point?    Honestly, arm yourselves with the info about your treatment before you succumb to the wishes of your (often outdated) oncologists.  Chemo kills more people than it saves, it is poison.  Just make sure you research this and are informed please.   Jxxxxx"
8013,I am asking for prayers for Dawne sweet sisters. She has been at the hospital since about 11:30 our time. She has a deep blood clot in her jugular vein. It is a very dangerous situation. She is scared and worried. She is still in the ER Dept but as soon as they get her to a room I am going to go to the hospital. Please cover her and Donald in prayer. I promise to update as soon as I can. God Bless

8692,"I just had to post this because I know so many of you are having frustrations with the breast spasms too.  I am only 1 month post op, had bilateral Mast. with immediate reconstruction, expanders.  I saw my Chiropractor just 3 weeks post op and told him about my muscle spasms.  He jump started the nerves in my chest and I haven't had a spasm since the evening of my visit with him.  Those darn spasms are SOOO annoying and I just had to share this with all of you who are dealing with this aggrevation as well.  Give it a try, it has made my days so much less annoying and I've been able to come off pain meds since calming the spasms.  Joy"
8758,We're fine - only grass burned.  We were on an enforced evacuation this afternoon for a prairie fire for a while but it's contained now.  Called Hubby to get home in case and got dogs out (and papers) and sat to wait in case I had to run.  Neighbor (who likes to freak out over nothing) gave me her 6 ferrets to 'watch' - they are back with her now. 
8783,If we must be on Pink Bus or in Pink Waiting Room we need to buy the Pink Wine by the Case.... don't you gals agree?
8817,"I know this one isn't!  lol  I'll probably be resting all day Friday, recovering from Thanksgiving!  "
8828,"I feel the need to vent a little and this seems to be a safe place to do so.  I had a double mastectomy backing in /september with expanders placed for reconstruction.  It was trouble from the start and about 8 weeks later I had to have emergency surgery to have them removed due to a severe infection. I never even got to have any fills.  I was told that I could revisit recon at a later date.  My priority has been getting through chemo, (less than half way done). My problem seems to be that everyone, including all my doctors seem to think that I should start reconstruction again as soon as my chemo is done.  They make me feel ugly! What is the matter with me staying like this.  Yes, I am very aware that the feminine form is usually a lot more curvy than mine, I can wear my prothesesis when I chose to, I find them heavy and not too comfortable. My husband seems to feel the same as the doctors and I'm beginning to feel that my breasts are for everyone but me.  I should mention that I am 55 years young and in otherwise excellent health. I have had a total of 12 different surgerys in my life for everything from fibroids to gall bladder and the thought of another time under the knife terrifies me."
8847,"After a bucket of tears, hair is finally shaved. Thanks to my hubby and my daughter, they did an amazing job.  There were lots of tears shed, a lots of hugs and kisses but I finally let them do it. The hair loss was just more devastating,like others said, it's was harder to see the clumps of hair falling.. I finally accepted that it was bound to happen anyways. I cannot say it was a relief because I think I still feel numb. Tomorrow is another day, I hope I will be stronger to face the mirror when I wake up. For now, I gonna go sleep with my bandana and try to digest it more.  Another step done, a big step for me. I didn't do  that bad after all! God is great."
8951,2015-01-12.     Good luck tomorrow.I will be Praying for you.hope everything goes well for you.
8954,I have decided not to have the surgery to even the size of my breast (due to the reconstruction one is bigger than the other) or the nipple reconstruction surgery. I am almost 51 and have decided that I have had enough surgeries.  I have lived like this since my reconstruction surgery in january and have been happy.  The worst thing is that I have not and will not be able to wear a regular bra anymore due to the size differences in my breast.  I have found that sports bras are very comfortable and I have asked (my daughter and my Honey) for some pretty ones for my birthday next month. 
8988,Hi ladies well  I opened the other door today.  Today was my first day of taking arimidex. I had no idea that it costs so much. It was $324.99 for a 30 day.  Thank God I have insurance that covers it.  I just hope they cover it for the 5 years that I have to take it. I will keep everyone  posted on how I am feeling.

9070,Tomorrow I go to my breast surgeon. I will have answers regarding the mammo I had 2 weeks ago.  Keeping fingers crossed.  I trust her with my whole being and I know she will tell me one way or the other if there is anything to be concerned about.  This is the first time I have someone coming with me ... my sister.   She is my best friend.
9123,"I am currently in remission for non-hodgkin's lymphoma. Of course, one thought that lurks in the back of the mind is that once you've had one cancer, secondary cancers are more likely. And my doctor point blank told me that since the lymphoma was in a large tumor in my lungs, and since I am young, I have a greater risk for breast cancer. Thankfully, I refused radiation to the tumor, for radiation would have increased my risk for breast cancer even more."
9147,"sschedule for bilateral mastectomy on Wednesday. Not looking forward to it, but have come to terms with it. Hopefully pathology comes back good, then I will be on my home stretch. I finished chemo in July. I don't like surprises, so if there ua anything that anyone has experienced that u think it might be useful for me to know, would appreciate the feedback."

9325,I just got home from my first chemo treatment. I survived. I was pretty nervous going in but the nurses were wonderful. They explained everything so calmly and really put me at ease.  I'm drinking lots of water like you all told me to but I have to stay close to a bathroom :)  My next appointment is January 2.  I'll keep you posted.  
9495,"I was so surprised to receive such a lovely card from all the ""Hershey Girls"" today.  So wonderful that they could take time out from their fun weekend to think of me and all sign a card for me.  I am truly honored and amazed at the love and kindness shown to me."
9530,Thanks for being with me at my oncologist visit yesterday. I felt all of your love and spirit with me. My doctor looked at the rash and feels that it must be an irritation or something other than a local recurrance. She would like me to see a dermotologist to further investigate. She did set my mind at ease by telling me if it was a return  of bc it would come back as a nodule and not the little bumps that I have. So its basically up to the dermotologist to figure out what is going on. Thank you again for your support it means the world to me. Love Surf
9533,She was released from the hospital today.  The doctors said that she had something called an eye stroke caused by her blood not circulating correctly due to a drop in blood pressure.  All of this is treatable with meds. 
9564,"Well I had another PET scan on Friday because my new onc wasn't happy with the MRI and wanted to make sure I was really in remission.  MRI showed old stuff in liver that my ""old"" onc thought was nothing.  He said some residual scarring would always be there.  However, I was glad to get the PET to make sure. "

9890,"Its been a week and I feel good! I think I psyched myself up last night because today is our 27th wedding anniversary and I told myself I better feel good. Woke up early to go to church, had a brunch with family and just enjoyed the day. I hope that this recovery period will be uneventful so I will be so ready for the next treatment.The worst time I can remember was the 5th day , when early morning I woke up with the intense back and thigh pains, had to take some pain medicine, another sleeping pill and that put me back to sleep. When I woke up again, the pain was gone....right now, just some bloating, itching especially my scalp and  mild aches /pains....just concern with my itchy scalp, I wonder if this is a sign of the hair falling off soon....but, I will not think of that now...I will take one treatment at a time...first one wasn't that bad, I hope and pray the second one won't be either! Thank you all my friends out there for thinking of me!"

So we kicked the hell out of it! Now I am concentrating on getting physically better. Radiation to follow and still don't know if I need chemo, I will see my oncologist this coming week. But whatever it's gonna be, I am ready,At least I could breath much better now!.If I will need chemo, my surgeon said its an insurance that the cancer will not come back in the future..Its been a hell but God be the glory and I came out a stronger person!"

10873,"I don't have to make the decision, the doctor stopped the chemo.  I went to the pharmacy and the Pharmacist looked at the rash on my face and neck, told him it was everywhere, what should I buy?  He made me call my doctor, said it was an allergic reaction to the chemo.  The doctor told me to stop the chemo, take Benedryl for the next 2 days and I will see him on Monday.  He said if my breathing gets difficult to call him and go to the ER.
Now that he made the decision to stop it, part of me is relieved and the other part is scared.  Even though I have been miserable since starting it.
Prayers and hugs to all,

10978,"Hi everyone. It's Jackie. I haven't checked in for a while, but I really need some wisdom/empathy. I finished my 4 courses of Adriamycin/Cytoxan. Last week I got the 1st of 4 courses of Taxotere. I was told this would probably be easier on me. Wrong! The first 2 days were better, but then it hit! I have been in ""total body pain"" for the past 3 days. Literally everything hurts! I'm not just talking body aches. The pain is so intense, I've had to take Percocet round the clock! I've become very depressed and just want to quit chemo and have surgery. I honestly don't know how I'll make it thru 3 more treatments. And as miserable as I feel now, if I do manage to finish chemo, I don't see how I can possibly continue working. Between the pain and the fog from the Percocet, I'm not much good these days. And I can't help but worry, if the chemo is affecting me so severely, what other nasty effects is it having on my body? Can anyone give me any info about going on disability? I'm afraid I may have to resort to that, if I have any hopes of seeing this thru. Sorry to be such a stick-in-th-mud, but I have reached an all-time low.            Jackie"

11191,My father started Taxol 10/15/12.  Started bone pain Thursday 10/18/12.  Now has had a bad sore throat since yesterday.  He does not have a fever but I am worried.  Is it a Chemo side effect or an infection?  Has anyone else had sore throat after Taxol that wasn't infection related??  Also he is due for his Chemo tomorrow morning. Do they cancel Chemo for sore throat/possible infection??  WOuld appreciate help...this is new ):
11260,"I recently posted that I had a breast ultrsound on Thurs. the 7th! The pain in my shoulders, chest, arm,breast,ect. is definitely worsening. The Vicodin was at least helping keep pain manageable before until a few wks. ago. I expect to hear something about the ultrasound tomorrow and further instructions. My question is, do I call the doc and tell them pain is worsening? I also seem to have urge to use Bathroom much more (Urinating). No fever, just pain persists and is worse:p I am terrified I may have rib, bone mets? The doc knew about the pain when I saw him last but I now have shouulder pain as well with frequent BR trips:p Also wondering what will come next! Will doc order more tests or refer me to breast specialist or both? I would like to have lab done for tumor markers, minimum! I would prefer lab and CT scan if possible if I have to wait to see breast specialist! Any thoughts, comments, suggestions from anyone would be most welcome!!!! Thank you so much in advance!"

I had a double mastectomy with no reconstruction.  I had 6 rounds of TC chemo, 28 days of radiation and Neulasta shot 1 day after chemo which did make me tired enough to sleep for several hours the following day.  Fortunately I had no adverse reactions to anything.  I used plastic ware for eating and Biotene toothpaste & mouthwash.  My oncologist has me taking Anastrazole (generic for Arimidex) for 10 years.  My xrays have been clear and I am still dancing with NED :-) On this board there is so much information and an opportunity to ask and post anything you are concerned with regarding your breast cancer.  Many read posts for awhile before actually posting anything themselves.  Do what you feel comfortable with.  {{hugs}}"

There were lots of tears shed, a lots of hugs and kisses but I finally let them do it. The hair loss was just more devastating,like others said, it's was harder to see the clumps of hair falling.. I finally accepted that it was bound to happen anyways. I cannot say it was a relief because I think I still feel numb. Tomorrow is another day, I hope I will be stronger to face the mirror when I wake up. For now, I gonna go sleep with my bandana and try to digest it more.  Another step done, a big step for me.

12200,Is there anyone over 55 who is taking Femara for treatment who is experiencing severe joint pain as similar to arthritis as a side effect?  What does your doctor tell you.  And how bad is the pain.  I have been taking it one month and I have days of very severe joint pain.  Help??
12212,I had my bi-lateral mastectomy with reconstruction (expanders) 2 weeks ago.  My skin around my breast and under arms is so sensitive.  It feels like a really bad sunburn.  My cloths hurt to the touch.  It's funny because it still feels numb too.  Is this normal?  Someone please help!
12226,Finally got my results from the test to see the chances of my tumor recurring.  I was in the low risk so thank heavens no chem or radiation!  I can continue with my reconstruction.  I have to take the drug Femara for 5 years.  generic name is letrozole.  Are there any precautions with that drug?  It will be a Merry Christmas for our family!!
12266,"So it's been about 6 months since I finished chemo. About 6 weeks post-chemo, I started experiencing severe joint pain. Mainly in my hands & wrists, knees, and hips. I was on pretty heavy duty painkillers for a few months, and it started feeling better, so I was down to taking a combination of ibuprofen and tylenol to control the pain. Well, the pain has flared up again. Now it's not only extremely painful, but my hands are swelling up at random times, I'm having trouble sleeping because I can't get comfortable, and I'm not getting any relief. I called my Onc yesterday about it - I had a check up appt scheduled for Friday anyway, but I explained to them that I was having terrible pain & wanted to see him a.s.a.p. so they got me in this morning. Dr told me that at 6 months past chemo it should be out of my system, and that's not causing my pain. Along with my regular blood work he ordered all kinds of tests for rheumatoid issues as well as lupus. All I know is - I'm 35, I feel like i'm 65. I don't walk - I shuffle. I have a 2 and 1/2 yr old at home and i cant pick her up half the time. I didn't have this pain AT ALL before I had chemo. He says it's NOT a side effect from the tamoxifen im on, either. So, I'm to call back in 2 days for my test results and other than that, he said he'd see me in a month. I'm so upset and frustrated. I hurt SO BAD. I just can't accept that this is just part of cancer treatment and I need to learn to live with the pain. I know I will never be the same person as I was before cancer. But I refuse to accept that I just have to live with this. Do any of you have anything similar going on?
thanks!

12275,"H Everyone!  I wanted to share my pathology report. No cacer found in lymphnodes or the breast. The 6cm tumor was gone!!! I had a complete response to chemo, prayer and faith in God!  I could hardly  contain myself after getting this news!! The doctor still recommends radiation simply because it was TNBC.  I continue to pray for all of my BC sisters and chemo buddies, and I ask that you continue to pray for me.  We truly need each other during these times!!"
12283,I just found out yesterday (Friday) that I have cancer in my lymph nodes and liver. It has not quite been a year since I finished treatment for breast cancer. I go in next week for biopsies and a bone scan. And you know how it is in the office...never think of the questions to ask until you leave and there is no one to ask. :)
12323,"I had a lumpectomy in December followed by radiation which finished up at the end of February. In mid-April my ""boost"" site started to itch like crazy and then it spread out from there--you could see the exact outline of the whole breast radiation. Then the rash traveled to my arms, legs, and back. I've stayed away from the sun. Miserable! I have been to the radiologist, oncologist and dermatologist and have been on high dose steroids, which I hate! I will begin testing for new allergies/sensitivities this week. I  know it is ""just a rash"" but it is the most intense itching I've ever known. I can't wear a regular bra and can only do a soft sports bra with soft cotton t-shirts...not great for my job!  I am trying an anti-inflammatory diet to see if that helps. Certainly I'm not the only one who has been through something like this...I know many get a radiation rash at the site, but has anyone had it all over? I do have sensitive skin.    "

12577,"I am seeing a plastic surgeon this week to discuss reconstruction after having a mastectomy, chemo and radiation a year ago.  I would prefer to use my own tissue rather than an implant because I feel that the implant side will feel different than my remaining breast, and I have come to understand that using an implant under radiated tissue isn't preferred by physicians."

I'm now having pain and numbness in my wrists and hands which is getting worse. Like some of the other posts I have been reading, I too feel like an old lady (45). I have trouble standing up, my joints ache etc.. etc.. etc.. so I'm wondering if anyone has decided to switch from Arimidex to Tamoxafin (sp)?  Have you felt better? I was taking Tamox first and had no side effects, but the Dr. felt my chances were better with Arimidex. Has anyone been told the same thing? Second has anyone had or heard of mets occurring while taking Arimidex? Thanks in advance for any info. Liz "
12700,"Hi Ladies,"
12810,"Just week ago after my needle biopsy and MRI I was diagnosed with Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Clinical Stage IIB. There is a possibility of nodes involvement since I have pain under my right arm and in my arm (it is swelling). I met with multidisciplinary team and they decided to go with chemo first. My IDS stage IIB-1 is grade 3 (aggressive), plus it is triple positive (ER+, PR+, Her2 3+). I was explained that in my case (Her2+) the best to start chemo first with addition of drug to treat Her2+. Also, they have scheduled a node biopsy and PET/CT scan. My only hope, the cancer has not spread in other parts of body...
Has anybody had this type of breast cancer and what was the treatment? Even though different body could react differently to therapies, what are the overall prognosis? Thank you for your support."
12877,"Hi, I'm hoping someone can share helpful experience about dealing with the tightening of scar tissue I have after a double mastectomy with sentinel node removal.  I had the surgery 2 months ago.  Everyday for the first 6 weeks I did strtching/range-of-motion exercises 3 times a day.  If I missed one, I noticed the tightening right away and knew I couldn't reduce frequency from that.  After about 6 weeks, I began getting back in to normal activities and thought I had set up the healing just fine and didn';t need to add these stretches so frequently because I was ""done.""  "
13009,"I just got a Facebook message from a friend. She had her mammogram a couple weeks ago, was diagnosed with breast cancer, had a PET scan that showed mets to ribs, spine, pelvic bones, proximal femoral bones, sternum and proximal humeral bones.  Right breast lit up so she'll be having an ultrasound and a bone biopsy."
13086,hello I am 30 yrs old and diagnosed with stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma In the right breast. Saw two breast surgeon and one recommend double mastectomy and the other one says lumpectectomy with radiation. Mri showed lump to be 1.7x1.3 and positive for estrogen and progesterone. I have no family history And having hard time making a decision. 
13109,"im double negative HER2 positive IDC I was on TCHP treatment and 2 minutes into my second infusion of Taxotere I had a bad reaction, my throat closed and it was  very hard to breathe, my pulse and blood pressure went through the roof and crazy back pain, after  they got me stable I continued with CHP (i didn't finish the taxotere). a few days later I went back to my oncologist and he is now recommending surgery and AC chemo once I've healed.  Has anyone had the same reaction?  "

13454,"I had an estrogen driven tumor, am post menopausal and have been diagnosed with vaginal atrophy. can't use estrogen products, nothing very effective so far.  anybody have experience with this and any advice?"
13463,"Hello!  I was wondering for those of you that have finished with treatment, how often do you follow up with MO, BS, RO?  Being naive, I thought that after I finished up with treatment, I would follow up every six months.  I am being asked to follow up with all of my doctors after three months.  Is this typical?"
13503,"After three and a half weeks I finally got my last two tubes out today!  My bi-lateral mastectomy with skin/nipple saving recon began on Aug 21st.  I had four tubes put in & the first two were removed on ""schedule""' about 8 days later.  However, these last two just kept producing an amount above what my PS allowed before removing.  Yesterday I called into the office & proudly read off my readings to their office personnel who made me an appt for today.  I feel like a free woman.  In only two days I can actually take a real shower again!  Thats exciting!"
13691,"I was diagnosed with TNBC in October.  Just completed 4 rounds of AC and had 2nd round of Taxol yesterday.  It looks like the possibility of achieveing a PCR prior to surgery is out of reach - tumor has only shrunk from 3.8 to around 3.0.  Also, my case is a little unusual in that I'm TN, but my PR receptors are weakly positive (30%)."
13695,"I had a bone scan awhile back and it showed a little arthritis.  I've been taking tylenol for it, and it works ok, but, I wondered what the rest of you might be taking and how it works for you.  I just hate to take it everyday.  I know it can't be good for my stomach. "
13703,"I was originally diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in October 2015. I completed four rounds of Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide in March 2016, had lumpectomy in April. Sentinel node biopsy showed no node involvement. On June 1, I started daily radiation (35 treatments in total). Last week I was informed that the pathology of the removed tumor showed that I am not triple negative, but I am HER2positive, and I must now start Herceptin infusions every three weeks for the next year. It was explained to me that it would have been better for me if the HER2-pos diagnosis were known while I was undergoing chemo so I would have had a head start on the Herceptin, but starting it now the only drawback is missing the opportunity to have started Herceptin earlier.  Has any of you ladies experienced receiving Herceptin alone after chemo? "
13738,What was your experience with breast reconstruction and what kind did you have?  Any resulting/longlasting pain?  Would you recommend it?
13769,"Hope someone has some insight to the future and can tell me which direction to go.  I had my 6 month check up on Friday.  To my surprise instead of saying ok your done, they said that I shouldn't be having my periods and that I am producing estrogen.  Since my tumor was estrogen positive, that is not good.  I went through chemo and am on Tamoxifin, but my periods returned in August and have been regular.  Now Tamoxifin in premenopausal women causes ousteoporisis, cancer in the uteris and all kinds of side effects, now it should be stopping my period, but now they want to give me Zoladex every 28 days, implanted into your stomach.  The side effects to this drug is many.  But it will stop the estrogen.  I believe removing my ovaries would do the trick as well.  They are afraid because of my age (38) that it will open a new can of worms.  I am also a juvenile diabetic, so surgery is quite a ordeal for me.  The scale is tilting both ways, advantages - disavantages. If I choose to have my ovaries removed and run into problems - oh well.  But the Zoladex has a great barrier in helping me with my nausea (because of gasteoporisis - caused by diabetes)The reglan drug I take to help me with that is one that can not interact with the Zoladex implant.  The Zoladex also gets implanted every 28 days in the hospital for 5 years.  Ugh.  What advice do you have.......  I really don't know what I am going to do.  The doctor feels the Zoladex is the way to go.  But I am trying to be my own advocate in this stupied medical field and go the easiest and surest way.  I am going to return this body under the lemon law.  I think I got a lemon how about you all?  "

14161,"Hi. I am new to this world of breast cancer.  I am 34 years old.  I found my lump myself and already had a yearly exam with my gyno scheduled.  When I asked at my appointment he referred me to a cancer surgeon.  She took and ultrasound in the office and said she didn't believe it was cancer.  I had surgery to remove the lump and the pathology came back as stage 1 cancer.  I was completely blown away.  I then went for a mammogram and an MRI. I then had a second surgery to place my chemo port and have lumpectomy done and clean up the margins.  I start chemo in a week and a half and I went ahead and got my wig this weekend.  I thought it would have been a fun experience to be able to pick out a style and color.  To my suprise it wasn't fun at all, in fact I ended up crying. My oncologist suggested shaving my head before my hair falls out because it is so long.  He said with it shaved I have less chance of it clogging my drains and it's not as messy when it does fall out. I keep having an argument with myself trying to convince myself to shave my head and I can't bring myself to do it. I thought about waiting until it falls out naturally but then I have to face the public that I work with with a balding head. I thought if I do it this while I am still off from work recovering from my second surgery I can take this time to cry and get used to wearing the wig and get myself pulled together before going back to work.  I need some help with this decision.  What did you do? Did anyone else have this tug of war with themselves? I am not looking forward to chemo but that is just a thought right now and hasn't hit home yet.  It will probably hit me a day or two before my appointment and I'm probably going to hit the floor and be in and crying heap on the floor. I have so many feelings running through me.  My family has been great with helping me through this as they have been down this road before with another member. Everyone at work keeps saying the words, ""you can do this, you're a fighter"" some days I just want to scream because they are always the same words.  I know they don't know how to handle my news or know what to say. I'm glad they are there to support me. I shouldn't complain then I feel guilty for doing so. Does anyone else have these mixed feelings? Sometimes I catch myself wondering if my husband will remarry when I'm gone then I shake my head and say out loud to myself, ""you're not going anywhere"". Once again, does anyone else feel this way in the beginning? I just don't know how to handle some of the thoughts and feelings that I am feeling. I need someone to talk to that can realate to what I am going through. "

14785,"Hey all and thanks for reading what I am about to put. I am new to this board. I have had a lymph node under my left arm swelling up for the past 2 years. It will swell up and go down some (put you can still see puffiness under my arm). When it is swollen it's so sore and it seems so raw. I have to hold hot wash clothes to it for it to feel some better. I have finally got insurance and have went to the breast clinic. The lady that was doing my mammogram she asked me where was my problem and I raised my arm and she seen it right away. She did get a picture of it so they could see it. She told me I would be called back and I have been. I was called back and they told me they did see the place under my arm and they have seen something in my right breast also. They said it was a spot in my right breast and my right breast was extremly smaller than my left breast the one I am having trouble from. I have had a polyp in my colon that was stage 1 cancer, so I am having some of the worse thoughts you all can probably imagen. I am 37 and not in the best health anyway. My mom, grandmother, and 11 of my grandmother's sister has all had cancer and 75% of their daughters and their daughters have. So I truly am expecting that they will tell me I have breast cancer. I am scared that I have waited to long too. I have already told my husband even if I don't have breast cancer I want a double masectomy because I already know I have the cancer gen in my body and my mom's side of the family is full with breast cancer. I am so scared, I can't even put it in words. I have 2 kids 7 and 13 and I can't imagen leaving them and my husband. I am a Christian and I am saved by the grace of God but I am still scared. Can anyone tell me what yall think. I feel so stupid writing on here, but I thought it may help me. I am praying for you all on here! Love in Christ, Amanda"

I had DCIS left breast with mastectomy being my only choice. No chemo or rads and I'm ER-, PR- so no hormone therapy. I never found a support group that fit for me and maybe that was my fault but when I sit and listen to what other women have gone through with the chemo, hair falling out, nausea, etc. I just don't feel like I fit in. I'm not even sure I have the right to call myself a breast cancer survivor since I didn't have to go through any of it. When I have looked into programs that I've heard about I usually am told they are for women going through chemo or rads so I'm still looking. I saw an oncologist that said DCIS isn't really cancer! Than can someone please explain to me why I had to loose my breast? Is there anything for those of us with DCIS?
I feel so awful feeling like this but I can't tell my friends or family-they think I'm so strong and over it. This is my fault because when I had my surgery they were so worried so I just acted like it was fine, I was fine no problems and I went back to work after 3 weeks so on the outside I have to be ok. On the inside I'm a mess! I'm scared of the cancer coming back and having to do this again, I'm still having pain and I really feel UGLY!

16323,"I'm almost a year out from my last radiation after chemo and a single masectomy. Frankly, I felt better last year. This year I know way to much about this survivor crap. The new normal will never be real to me, I kept expecting to get some energy back or some strength, not to be pukey all the time, to have a real mind again, to get a job and be a somewhat productive part of the world again. I'm just too tired to start again from scratch, Wish I'd never done treatment at all but I listened to the Docs without really, really thinking about results. If you're late 50's early 60's and single don't forget that when your vacation/sick time is used, you not only won't have an income, you won't have any insurance either. After you sell everything you can and spend all your retirement and savings you get to humiliate yourself to the hospital accounting department begging for help. When you get through everything and go job hunting, good luck, a 60 yr old *cancer person* yeah, right, there's a good choice huh? I wouldn't hire me either, too risky for insur. reasons. So now I vented, it's 3:40 am, maybe I can sleep?"
16363,"YUP .... doc came in and said that the nodules are stable.  I jumped up and hugged him!  I said ""I am not coming back.  I am done!""  He smiled and says ""I hope you understand that you need to continue to be followed for 5-10 years and that you will consider being checked at least every year.""  WOW!  I've been going every 3 months for a year now and to hear once a year ... DEAL!  "
16380,It's that time again. EEK!  Going in Monday for my mammo and ultrasound and praying that everything will be ok.  I want NED to continue dancing with me!
16417,What was your experience with breast reconstruction and what kind did you have?  Any resulting/longlasting pain?  Would you recommend it?
16477,Hi. I know on other posts we have discussed hair growing back different color or different texture but Id like to ask if anyone has had any experience with hair simply not growing back in a certain spot or maybe growing in shorter than the rest.
16540,"My 4th and last red devil is on Monday and I will be so glad! I have not had a lot of SE and what I have had were not terrible. Thank God! The 3rd was the worst and within a week I was wiped out physically, but, feel much better now.  The dr. is going to wait 3-4 weeks to give me a short break before we start the 12 weekly Taxol.  I will be glad and hope my taste comes back enough between these drugs to eat some good stuff."
16615,I'm not sure how to express this.  I have several friends and family members who have said goodbye. Two freinds I've had for 30 plus years have recently said goodbye to our friendship.  I'm very sad and wondering why.  The only explanation I have come to understand is my cancer. 
16630,"I am so sorry it has been way to long since I have been here to update, I apologize to all of you. Dawne continues to hang in there and fight. She has had a rough couple of weeks but I am praying things are settling down for her and she will feel better soon. She is staying strong and being her wonderful self! She has a strong support system and her 7 yr old granddaughter loves to be her nurse and take care of her! I know you all are but keep Dawne and her family in your prayers.She appreciates it so very much. We have plans to meet up next Monday evening. I hope she is up to it."
16681,"I just wanted to update y'all on Dawne. She is hanging in there. She has chemo every other Monday. It is rough on her but she is fighting hard. Her faith holds her strong. She will be having a PET scan on the 30th so please keep her in your prayers. Her younger sister (early 30's) was dx about 6 wks ago with stage 3 cervical cancer. It has been hard on Dawne because her sister lives in another state,she would love to be with her. She will have chemo and rads starting the 22nd, please keep her in your prayers too."
16746,"Has anyone here gone through the treatment regimen of lumpectomy, chemo, radiation, while living alone? I do not want to put my extended family through needing to drive me to treatments, etc. Also, will I be able to take care of myself, drive 2 hours each way for treatment? I am semi retired, so I don't need to worry about that. I am trying to make decisons and I know everyone is different, but it would help me to know that this is doable alone. Has anyone handled all this alone? Thanks."
16827,"I'm so sorry if I worried anyone. I have been so busy, going to Dr's apps and testing for every thing under the sun LOL.. Plus I went back to art. I use to draw and paint 26 years ago and I started drawing again and I am loving it. I quite when we moved to the country and had my horses at home. I would go to work and do 12 hours and then come home and ride for a couple of hours. So the art went by the way side. And as some of you know my cancer came back last summer. So I am back in chemo for the rest of my life they tell me. I hope I'm on chemo for a long long time.LOL. Been doing pretty good until I got Bronchitis and had to go back on oxygen Ugh..At least I only need it when I go out. I hope every one here has been  healthy and well. I think of you all each day. I have been here to read up. I don't know why I didn't see this post. You are all in my prayers. And I won't let so much time go by again with out a post."
16831,A late and kind of crazy late night discharge last night - home at 9:30 PM.  I am home on TPN/lipids/insulin - all via my port to strengthen me up for my upcoming battle.  I see the onc on Thursday and my biopsy should be back then.
16847,"This past Tuesday, I started the first of 4 taxols.  Was tired after, but couldn't sleep even with sleeping pills.  But yesterday, I started to feel like I was hit by a Mac truck.  It's hard to take a deep breath in. I'm trying the tylenol first, if that doesn't work, will do Ibprophen.  Then on to Vicodin."
16871,On Monday I had my 3rd mammo since my dx and treatment. I am very happy to report that the news came back all clear. I am still dancing with NED!
16877,"Well I had another PET scan on Friday because my new onc wasn't happy with the MRI and wanted to make sure I was really in remission.  MRI showed old stuff in liver that my ""old"" onc thought was nothing.  He said some residual scarring would always be there.  However, I was glad to get the PET to make sure. "

16993,I just found out that I have triple negative breast cancer. They are saying it's stage 1A and it's not in the lymph nodes. I am 44 years old. I've opted for a double mastectomy with reconstruction. I have to do chemo. Has anyone had a similar situation? I'd love to hear about it. I'm scared of the recovery. I don't want to be in pain or lose my hair.
16995,"Both of my sons are Type 1 diabetics.  Some of you may remember that my firstborn needed a kidney which I was approved to donate 4 years after my stage 1 diagnosis. Everything went great and I have been happy for the first time in years.  My younger son who is also diabetic but has no complications yet was married last Oct. He just found out he is sterile.  Nothing to do with diabetis.  They said he is just unlucky.  Like childhood diabetes is not unlucky enough..  I have been devestated for 3 days.  Not because I am attached to the genetics because I would be happy to see this diabetic chain end but because of how sad my son is.  I am really tired of bad news.  It is so hard to see my children continue to suffer.  When I was first diagnosed, people questioned why I wasn't crying and more visably upset.  With 2 diabetic sons and one on dialysis, it was not the worst thing that ever happened to me.  My biggest fear has always been that I would outlive my sons.  Please pray for Andrew.  I told him that love not genetics make a parent.  Hopefully they will find another way to make it happen."
17064,"I saw my oncologist Tuesday to go over the results of the PET scan. My day actually started with a very urgent sounding lady from the lab insisting I get a hold of my provider immediately. Evidently she didn't realize this was blood work ordered by my oncologist as it seems my tumor markers were way elevated. (7. something)
I had been concerned about a muscle spasm in my right back and hoped it wouldn't light up like Times Square on the scan. I'd had this problem since early April and I thought it was from my new keyboard.
After getting the results yesterday I now know what I'm facing and it's not good. Evidently I have 2 spots on my spine (T2 and T9) as well as mets to the 12th rib. So the pain wasn't a muscle spasm at all but bone mets.
I was to have my port installed yesterday morning but the imaging machine at the hospital went on the fritz and I've still heard nothing about rescheduling.
I will be starting 6 rounds of CMF (Cytoxan, Methotrexate and Fluorouracil) probably next week. Not sure what the prognosis is for the bone mets but I've heard not so good.
Anyone else dealt with this?

Lymph nodes and margins all came back clear with the final path. Stage 1 Grade A. My tumor size was 1.9 cm, borderline from being a stage 2 siince stage 2 is ttumor size of 2cm. Pet scan was negative but my mammostrat study I was scored hi moderate. I will be starting my chemo after thanksgiving, a series of 4 every 21 days of Taxotere and Cytoxan.

I will put a brave face this thanksgiving and I will do my best to enjoy the  day with my family and friends.

17358,I am feeling very sad tonight. I lost another friend to the monster that is cancer. She fought hard for 2 years but lost her battle. I hate cancer!!!
17467,"I have read so many stories of how families rally around their family member with cancer.  My situation couldn't be more different.  I feel that my family has abandoned me.  I am single and I have a mom and three older brothers.  All are local except for one brother.  When I was first diagnosed I told my brothers. The two who are local told me that I couldn't tell my mother because it would just be too much for her to handle after my Dads death a year earlier.  I could not believe what they were saying to me!  Not tell my mom?  Reluctantly I agreed to hold off on telling her until after my lumpectomy surgery when I had a definitive treatment plan.  After surgery (which I went to by myself) it was determined that I would need chemo, a mastectomy, and radiation.  In my mind, it was time to tell my mom.  I told my two local brothers that they needed to join me for the ""discussion"".  In my mind, they needed to be there for their mom.  I had to practically drag them there.  They did not want me to tell her but I had to....I was going to need help.  Although we had the discussion, my brother completely downplayed the whole thing and said that I had surgery and I was now fine.  What????  I was so stunned I couldn't say anything.  I was days from my first chemo treatment.  I left my moms house in a daze.  I started chemo a few days later.  I attended every chemo treatment by myself.  My brothers never offered to join me, never offered me help that I desperately needed.  They did nothing.  I was all alone.  There were some days during Taxol where I had really bad pain and if I had a bullet and a gun I would have used it.  I had to lie to my mother and tell her that I was traveling on business so she wouldn't call me.  I would not have been able to hide my pain in my voice.  My other brother did his best from 500 miles away.  He called all the time, sent me flowers, etc.  He and I eventually decided to tell my mom because I was going to need help after my mastectomy.  He flew into town and we told my mom.  It wasn't easy but it was finally done.  I was so bitter about my brothers behavior that I told my mom that they abandoned me...they did nothing.  My mom had a reaction that floored me...she defended them.  It was like a knife in the gut.  I could not believe what I was hearing.  Needless to say, my relationship with my family is broken.  Im wondering if I ever had one to begin with.  I would not treat a stranger the way they have treated me.  I am so hurt and so bitter.  Im crying like a baby as I write this.  Please tell me someone else has gone through this?  Please tell me I'm not the only one?"
17503,Have any of you decided not to take arimidex when diagnosed with estrogen positive breast cancer and not had a reaccourance?
17772,"Anyone else who had a lumpectomy, is your breast still very tender. Mine is, especially around the areola which is where the tumor was removed from. I had chemo and radiation. It got a lot more tender after radiation. Just wondering if this is normal and if anyone else has notice the swollen and tenderness still especially since its been a year since I had the tumor removed."
17802,"Got my port this morning. Nurse had to stick me twice to get my IV in, reinforced my decision to get a port. Did it without sedation or IV pain med, just local numbing medicine. He touched a nerve once that gave me a jolt but he quickly added deeper numbing medicine and the rest of the time I just felt the tugging and pushing, no pain. No sedation meant I could eat right away and no nausea. Took some Extra Strength Tylenol and spent a couple hours at a reunion of hospital employees and then a friend picked me up and we spent a couple hours doing day 1 of the annual community flower and garden tour."
17809,It took two months for the them to do it. It is nice to have two spots. We had to call the cops to write a ticket for someone that had parked in it last night. The person was not disabled. The complex now knows that you cant have two disable people fighting for one spot.
18041,ok i know i cant get my tram flap reversed but i wanted to put this out there to so many ladies that have experienced breast cancer and let me know what you think. i had breast cancer in 1996 then i had a lot of crazy things happening to me the last couple of years so i oped to have both my breast removed. i was tired of being scared as i am 57 yrs old and have 13 yr old daughter living with me at home. so my general surgeon said he thought it was best if i had reconstruction done at the same time. i wasnt really looking to do that i just wanted the problem gone. anyways i took his advise and spoke to this plastic surgeon. he promised me the moon and the stars. he said i would have high and tight little boobies and a flat stomach again. so yes my vanity won. i did it. well i had complications. part of the radiated breast started to die. he graphed some skin and patched me and i was on a wound vac for a week. things did heal but my stomach was not flat and i have bulges under my breast and i asked to have small breast he did not give me small ones (to me small ones are a b cup) so i asked what was he going to do. first he told me that he would go back and fix the breast as they have a indention on the side that looks like a butt crack and give me nipples. well i asked him to do something about the muscle under my breast too. now he says he cant do anything about the bulges and they are not that bad and if he reduces my breast they will droop. they arent high and tight as it is. the stomach he says i should be happy most women my age are a lot bigger. so i went to duke and saw another dr and he said he would remove the muscle under the breast but not til the end of the year and he would re-shape my breast but there was nothing he could do for my stomach. ok i went back to the first plastic surgeon and he said the dr at duke was just putting me off and he didnt want to do it either as i had a 10 percent chance of losing one of the breast. i am not happy. i am considering having both breast and the muscle removed. it looks like i will have a hard time finding someone that will do this because i mentioned it to the dr at duke and he just said he didnt want to do that. and my doctor will not do that. so what i want is you guys to give me some in put on am i going to far with what i want or am i right. o and i didnt mention that the muscles under breast contract and agravate me every minute of everyday. my daughter says i am not the same person i was before the surgery. she says i'm always unhappy or hurt or dont feel good and just plain gruppy.  its not pain you need meds for or anything just always uncomfortable. nothing seems to fit the boobs due to the lumps under my breast and they are really ugly to me also.
18059,I am holding my own against this beast. And even better I have been released from seeing the onco . I can be watched by the PCP . I have two ultra sounds coming up to check on my thyriod and to see if my left arm is good or is it the beginnings of lyphedema if I spelled it forgive me. My right hip is giving me a fit but got told you lose the weight now body has to get use to the new weight. Got told to go home and rest and take the pains meds to calm down the nerve pain.

18060,"Finally met with my onc Wednesday and she prescribed Adriamycin/Cytoxan for 4 weeks, then taxol for another 12 weeks.  16 treatments.  Not what I expected.  I didn't get out of bed yesterday I was so upset.  I live alone, it's alot to digest.  Needing some hugs."
18073,"  I am having reconstruction done soon. My radiation burns were so bad that I had to postpone a week of the treatments out of my 7 weeks of treatment. I even had the expanders put in during my bilateral mascetomy, yet got infectons so I had to get them taking out.  My radiated skin is so tough and no amount of exercise seems to loosen it up much. So I looking into the lat flap type surgury now. Just curious if anyone who had to go through radiation is happy with their reconstruction, and if not is it because it looks very deformed or not right. I'm not expecting it to be perfect just want to know how those or you who have gone through it feel about the outcome. "
18085,"My wife had a bilateral mastectomy today and just came out of surgery, during the surgery they did a sentinal node mapping and biopsy.

Will she have to go through chemo again ?  The Surgon wouldn't answer the question when I asked him and just said we have to wait until the path report comes back..  Any one out there have a similar experiance, Positive lymph nodes found AFTER chemo?

I have trouble standing up, my joints ache etc.. etc.. etc.. so I'm wondering if anyone has decided to switch from Arimidex to Tamoxafin (sp)?  Have you felt better? I was taking Tamox first and had no side effects, but the Dr. felt my chances were better with Arimidex. Has anyone been told the same thing?

18743,"yep.....back on the old soapbox again.....I may need to explain why I get upset when people come on these boards talking about how they have cancer and even though there are treatments available, and some have proven to be effective, they decided for whatever reason to just not do any of it.  Then name your topic something like I have cancer and decided to do nothing. Or  I have cancer and don't want the inconvenience of maybe getting sick during treatments, so I'm not doing them.  The one that really bothers me is "" I hear some of the treatments may make me gain weight, so I choose to do nothing.  "

Also our Ocn recommended for her to drink at least one Boost or Ensure everyday to help with nutrition but all of those drinks have soy in them. Help !!!! "
19052,"All told, my cancer treatments took about nine months from chemo to surgery to radiation. I spent most of that time in bed, except during the breaks between treatments, because I was always exhausted. Exercise, other than the occasional slow walk around the block or grocery shopping trip, was out of the question. But as soon as radiation was over and the fatigue and blisters started to fade, I started slowly exercising and working myself up. Progress is frustratingly slow, despite what I feel are my best efforts. I get some kind of exercise (running, swimming, weights) 5-6 days per week, and although I can do the workout I assign myself and my stamina for doing the work keeps improving, my recovery is not. I end up being tired all afternoon, and sometimes I'm wrecked for the rest of the day...beyond what it was like when I was ""normal."" "
19100,"Isaac was the ""little"" storm that packed a terrible punch!  Many in my area flooded and are still without power.  We finally got power back last night and I am here to tell you that a hot shower is soooo wonderful!  Say a little prayer for the folks affected.  My older sister and her husband and two dogs are here napping.  They have no power and the heat wore them down."
19169,"For the past few months, I've developed extreme all-over itching when I get hot - hot flash, hot weater, exercise, anything that heats my skin.  It's making me crazy because it's getting hot now.  It goes away immediately when I get cooled down.  It's like what I imagine prickly heat to be, except not rash or redness.  Anyone have/had this?  I see oncologist on the 23rd, and this is hardly an emergency, just makes me want to tear all my clothes off (not a pretty sight) or stand in front of an a/c. Because I've never had this before, and because I'm a cancer survivor, it's worrying me."
19171,"Does anyone know how long the dry mouth symptoms last after chemo?  I finished all my treatments (ACT) 11 days ago and still have soreness & severe dry mouth.  I drink a TON of water throughout the day, use biotene mouthwash, salt/baking soda rinse, crest mouthwash (no alcohol in it) and brush at least 3 times a day.  I am going back to work in a week and was hopeful that the dry mouth would be gone soon.... I do get relief with constant gum chewing (sugar free with xylitol) but am not a fan of chewing gum.  Just wondering if anyone knows how long to expect this to continue!"
19191,"A friend of mine who had breast cancer and a double mastectomy a few years ago, has given these tips for me to pass on to my daughter in law.  She said that with Chemo comes terrible mouth sores and to combat those, she should take Kyolic Kyo-green.  She and a few others have sworn that this is the best stuff to use to get rid of the mouth sores immediately.  She also suggested for her to begin taking and continue throughout the Chemo Veggie Complete & Fruit Complete.
Just wanted to pass this along if it might help someone."

19319,"Now that I am on the three-month cycle for the oncologist (and am gradually dropping off the other involved doctors), I have decided that I need to make use of those pocket-sized calendars to keep track of when things out of the norm occur so that I can see if it occurs again/how often it occurs.  I can also jot down questions as they come to me.  Ijust see it as a handy way to document things for when I have my appointments.  "

Besides a couple of rough days, with fever and flu like symptoms, I have been doing OK, except now I have foot pain.  I know this could be part of the neulasta shot.  I was wondering if others got joint/bone pain right after the shot or does it develop gradually and overtime?  (The chemo I am on is Cytoxcin and Taxotere)"
19501,"Hello everyone, I finished chemo about four weeks ago. But my eyes are watering a lot. I've been to the eye's doctor but nothing is helping. Does anyone have that experience? Please let me know what you use."
19614,"Again,  I will post this question for women that have had complete masectomies.  Did you have your nipples completely removed?  I have the option.  The surgeon says that if i have the nipple saved then i will be put on a registry.  I guess they are still doing a study if the cancer will come back or not, and also any complications.  She says, too, that with the nipple saved it will still leave some duct and tissue left.  I already opted to have the nipple removed, and then later on go for the reconstruction.  BTW,  I am already done with chemo, and will have no radiation after this masectomy.  I am now having some second thoughts, and wishing to get some input from anyone out there, that has had either procedure done, and how it worked out for you."
19625,my surgery is coming up in a week.  I don't know what to expect in terms of pain level post-op (having double mastectomy).  I know I'll get pain meds but hate taking pills.  Is the pain level significant and how long does it last?
19631,"I've read a lot of comments about the drains after surgery being difficult.  Can anyone elaborate on what to expect?  My double mastectomy is slated for mid October.  Also can you elaborate on pain, recovery period, and what you probably cannot do the first week?  Thinking of having someone be with me (move in) first week to help.  Thank you!"
19672,In just 1 1/2 hours my husband and twin adult boys will drive me to the hospital for my double lumpectomy. I am scared. I have faith. This is one step closer to completing what I will be going thru. Send a thought/prayer my way.
19689,"It appears this isn't very common as I have searched all over the internet and on these boards for older posts and have found very little information. I developed an infection in the breast where I had the lumpectomy about 3 weeks after my radiation was over. First the breast swelled and became purplish red, then I became very sick, tired, chills, pain, some nausea. I went to the oncologist about 3 days after it started (regular appt) and he put me on antibiotics. I had another appt the next week with the breast surgeon. She extended the antibiotics for another week, drained fluid and had it tested. The draining was one mother-of-a-painful-experience BTW. Third appt another week later with the breast surgeon when she drained more fluid and 'palpated to check for pockets of infection'...another mother-of-a-painful-experience!"
19717,"I am now two weeks post op from my left sided single mastectomy. Today I tried to go out wearing a sports bra and a soft fiberfill form. I was so miserable, that I ended up removing both in the car. It was so uncomfortable and sore having it next to my skin. Will I always go bra-less with a uni-boob? Looks kind of wierd, but that is how I am most comfortable right now."
19725,"I was diagnosed with grade 1 breast cancer a week ago. the mass is still small...2 cm. I am so torn over what treatment to undergo. The lumpectomy seems like it would be least invasive. But, the radiation and hormone therapy sound pretty lousy.  Is it an overreaction to even be considering mastectomy? And even crazier to consider bilateral? Anyone else struggle with this?"
19758,"I have to take them off today and see my ""new normal"" for the first time. Am I going to need an Ativan? I am still in pain, but taking the Percoset. I guess it all can be forgotten with bandages snugly in the bra, but it will be a reality soon, so I am trying to prepare myself."
19879,Hello!  Please share your experience regarding your satisfaction/dissatisfaction with your Lumpectomy/Mastectomy/2xMastectomy with me.  I will have surgery in a couple of months and would like to know how you feel about the procedure that you had and your process.  Looking forward to hearing from you!
19886,It has been eight weeks since the mastectomy.  Five more weeks until phase two of the reconstruction. my expanded have seemed to move more side ways then forward.  I realize this will be fixed in the next surgery. in the mean time how do you feel feminine.  I am really struggling.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated
20111,"I had my Bilateral Mastectomy on 4/26/13...  3 weeks ago.  And the drain tubes were removed, 2 weeks ago.  I was wondering how long the breast skin that was left for reconstruction will remain swollen.  I look like I have breasts under my arms, and with the tissue expanders... I look like I have 4 breasts.  Its worse on the right side where they removed 20 lymph nodes.  The pain is minimal... I manage with Ibuprofin now.  I know each person is differant but how long did the healing take you.  Kathy"
20153,Hey everyone. I had my lumpectomy on Thursday. The margins were clean and I'll results tommorrow about the lymph nodes. It seems like they had to take out more lymph nodes then I originally anticipated with the sentinel node biopsy.  The underside of my arm is numb and feels sooooo weird. Will this go away?. I still have the drain in and that's probably  the only incision that really hurts. I'm suppossed to be a couch potato but it's really hard for me to do that with my personality!  
20249,"I finished my  chemo/radiation 8/2011 and since that time I have had a pretty low Iron count.  Normal is 10-129 and mine is 19.  Has anyone else experience low Iron counts?  I am nervous as online research states it could be another form of cancer.  However, my doc said not to be too concerned, they will run some tests, but am thinking this is pretty low.  Any kind of tips/hand holding is welcome!  Thank you!"

20480,"I had thougtht I would request the pink bus for today, as I had my 6 month mammo and followup visit with the surgical oncologist, but I got busy with the weekend holiday and forgot..  Ended up that I was there from 9 am - 3:30 pm today. What a ride!!!  When I kept sitting there and sitting there, I thougtht something might be amis..  A little while later, they called me back to take some more pictures.  I ask what did they see?  And the tech indicated that they saw something and circled it and wanted magnified pics.  So we did the lovely procedure again, but in more detail.  Then it was wait some more until the pics were read and then the radiologist called me back.  Said he saw an area with some more microcalcifications  near a previous  spot of a 2010 biopsy.  Now this is the opopposite breast  from last years', micorcalcifications turned abnormal hyperplasia, turned to cancer diagnosis.  So he wants to now compare today's films with the 2010 films to see if this particular spot has made any changes.  He wants to monitor this very closely.  So has anyone else out there had somelthing pop up in a previously biopsoied site four years later?  I don't think I'm too worried, but then again, I wasn't worried last year and that led to surgery and 7 weeks of radiation.  Knew I should have requested the pink bus.  I will from now on"

20553,"Hi, my name is Robin and I'm new here. I had my mastectomy a few months ago and have been looking for someplace to get info and advise. I had DCIS left breast with mastectomy being my only choice. No chemo or rads and I'm ER-, PR- so no hormone therapy. I never found a support group that fit for me and maybe that was my fault but when I sit and listen to what other women have gone through with the chemo, hair falling out, nausea, etc. I just don't feel like I fit in. I'm not even sure I have the right to call myself a breast cancer survivor since I didn't have to go through any of it. When I have looked into programs that I've heard about I usually am told they are for women going through chemo or rads so I'm still looking. I saw an oncologist that said DCIS isn't really cancer! Than can someone please explain to me why I had to loose my breast? Is there anything for those of us with DCIS?
I feel so awful feeling like this but I can't tell my friends or family-they think I'm so strong and over it. This is my fault because when I had my surgery they were so worried so I just acted like it was fine, I was fine no problems and I went back to work after 3 weeks so on the outside I have to be ok. On the inside I'm a mess! I'm scared of the cancer coming back and having to do this again, I'm still having pain and I really feel UGLY! Although my husband says I'm beautiful and he didn't marry me for my breasts I still feel like an alien."

20658,"So some of you may remember I was hospitalized 3 weeks ago with an infection and had to have my expanders removed 2 weeks before my exchange surgery was already scheduled! I experienced another emotional bi lateral mastectomy. It was so hard! This past thursday I had my stitches out and my tubes removed. On Friday evening I had a belly ache.. old fashioned belly hurts. I went to bed and woke up saturday with a belly ache. Not too awful bad but pain across my belly button and it hurt if I moved too fast. Sunday morning I knew something was definitely not right so I called my PS to rule out that it could be in anyway related to getting my tubes out etc. He said no and get to urgent care where I could have a white count done since I just came off this staph infection. I sat in urgent care waiting room for almost 2 hours, crying most of the time as my pain level went from 5 to 10 in no time!I finally saw the doc and he asked me a few questions while I was sitting on the table and then asked for urine specimen. No problem at my age! He came back with in 10 mins and said the specimen was clear and they would draw blood and CALL ME IN 24-48 hours! WTH?? He said see the ER if my symptoms got worse. My hubby was sooooo pissed. I was totally frustrated and aggravated by this point and tired so I told hubby please take me home I can see someone on Monday. He did take me home but was not content with that as I laid in bed crying. I know this post is long but you really have to hear the details.. I am still amazed at some of it. My daughter came over and explained to me that I really need to see about my white count and that I did not want ceptic and she named all sorts of things that could be going on. Hubby went to show her where my pain was and pushed on my belly~ I thought I would DIE! So I knew I was in trouble and agreed to go to ER. We got there at about 4pm. We sat for 4 1/2 hours. I cried, I begged my hubby to just take me home it was too painful to sit there and we were just told they were sorry they could not even begin to tell us how long we would wait. Well finally hubby found me a small couch like thing I could lay on and we got a pillow and I laid down to die. A friend he talked to on the phone told him to tell them I was cancer patient at the desk and see if it got us anywhere. He did and they should have had all that in their computers from my triage on arrival, but it wasn't so the nice little girl put the info in and with in 20 minutes I was in..thank you cancer you may have saved my life... weird huh? The ER doc asked a few questions and sent me for abdominal CT and at 230am Sunday/Monday I had my perforated, gangerous appendix removed. This hurts like h3ll ya'll! I have neve experienced anything so painful.. anyone else??
Thanks for listening to my long drawn out story. I just keep wondering how much more can I take and what next?

20713," One year ago I had my mastectomy...followed by another surgery to get clear margins.  After having radiation, my tissue expander moved out of place due to the radiated tissue encapsulating the expander.  That surgery was in December to re-position a new expander.  Now, four months later, my incision line has open sores that just aren't healing...Found out today, I have to undergo a skin graft...didn't realize they take the tissue & skin from my back...ugh!!!"
20894,"I was diagnosed with IDC left breast Dec. 2011 had lumpectomy and 30 radiation treatments, in Dec. 2012 I was diagnosed with IDC in my right breast had partial mastectomy and 30 radiation treatments. Lately started having problems with my teeth which were perfect before the cancer, went to the dentist today and she told me I have to have all of my teeth pulled the bone is gone. My oncologist never mentioned that I was supposed to see a dentist before I started radiation therapy, so now I've lost half of my breast and all of my teeth, I am mortified has anyone else had this problem?  My dentist says she doesn't understand why I was'nt informed of this by my oncologist."
21007,"I was diagnosised with breast cancer in 2010. I had recontruction surgery Jan 2012 and dr found cancer removed it, but did nto need any treatment. I had a body scan done and no cancer spoted. Then I had a body scan done in October 2012 and there was cancer on my spine. i had to have radiation again and now take a chemo medication once a month and a bone medication once a month. Oncologist told me i now have chronic cancer and need chemo for life. Oncologist said cancer will keep coming back just wont know when or where. But that i can survive it."

21238,"I were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 I had Lumpectomy surgery chemo and radition treatment. In June 2012 in came back, I had mastectomy with no treatment in september of 2012 I were told the lymph nodes were clear, we were told it spread to the my lungs, I have been on treatment with chemo. December 2013 we had good new the tumor is half the size it were. Just find out in the other breast I have intraductal papilloma. I will be going to see my doctor today to see what she will do. Anyone who have been through the same thing or any advise with help."
21407,"Good news first, Liver and lungs clear. Tumors are not putting pressure on spinal column.Bone scan shows the tumors that are stable are the T-spine which was radiated last year, along with the tight hip and right thigh, and a few in the ribs. The c-spine, left ribs, left hip, right knee, lumbar spine, tail bone, pelvic bones, shoulder bones backbone on the left side are show metabolic activity. She had a name for it when your whole skeletal system has tumors. Her recommendation is to get another opinion from a med onco who has not treated me. She would like them to do bone biopsies on about 5 or so of the active tumors to see if I am her2 +, as some of the tumor area looks like a honeycomb with chunks out, and other areas look like tumors are on top of eachother, and she would not be surprised if it is positive. The initial was undetermined and tumors responded well when I was on herceptin (until ins realzed I was undetermined for her). She will not do more external beam rads. Most of the red cells and platelets are produced in the hios, pelvic, spine, sacrum? If she radiates other areas it could make me sicker as there would not be enough good marrow left to produce the red cells needed. So if needed, she would do Quadromet (whole body oral rads). S/E could be lower white cell count, lower red cell and platelet that could mean transfusions. It should help with pain, but no guarantee. There are risk involved. And once you have quadramet, you can no longer recieve any systemic treatments, so it also limits the possibility of other treatments that may come up. So for now, I will continue on. Wait for appt w/a new med onc. I did ask her if I am stable, she kindof laugheedand said NO! didnt I just show you all the metabolic activity? I laughed amd said I just neededd to hear it bcuz my med onc said I am stable , my tumor markers lok good.
I told her I started thinking the pain and exhaustion were in my head!
She said the scans just proved it. So, I will stay on the Aromason for 2 more months in case it is slowing down the spread."
21505,"For those who have been here for a bit, You know I am stage iv. Most of 2013, I was in disagreement with my longterm onc. I had run out of option time to start Hospice. I disagreed. In Dec 2013. I finally got 2nd opinion a Huntsman Cancer Center. He said I was over treated with chemo, which is not effective on bone mets. Undertreated w/hormone blockers. The chemo did work on skin tumors and liver lesions. Iwas on chemo over 2 1/2 years. 5 chemos and the.bone.mets kept growing the whole time. New Dr. did tumor markers which were over 500, said tumors were aggressive. Started me on Femara, too much muscle and bone pain, but I was determined to make it work, after 7 weeks he stopped it. Said we still had Aromason. I waited 5 weeks til muscle and bone pain was tolerable b4 starting it. Told him I wouldnt be abl to tell if it was Aromason or Femara if pain continues. Since, only s/e have bee dry mouth and hot flashes. Markers dropped from 500+ to 26 & 25 the last 2 months. So I am excited to be STABLE! The excitement dropped when he said he has seen Aromason be effective for 18 - 24 months for on patient. I smiled and reminded him I was on it already for 16 months. He said it slipped his mind that I came from The Huntsman! I came home, told my boys that I am stable and would maybe look for a nce 1 bdrm apt. My kids do not like the idea of me living alone. For 4 1/2 years I have been told, times up, dont count on Christmas...etc. Now it is a big mindset change that I could be here longer. It is also frustrating knowing, had I been on Femara or Aromasoon, the tumors most likely would not havengrown so fast and chances are.I would not have all the pain bcuz, the blockers would have slowed the growth b4 it was in every bone in my body with the exception of hands and feet. Cant change the damage already done, but can learn to live with what I have left. I realize at this point I am on my last option, as it continues the spread to stop, it is continuing my ""HOPE"" THAT i will still be here when they have the immune therapy approved for Stage IV Breast Cancer."

She found out today she has a blood clot in that arm. Not good under any circumstances. She also has some kind of infection. They have taken a lot of blood and hope to figure out exactly what very soon. She is not in the hospital, I am sure knowing Dawne she fought the Dr hard on that!!

We met twice a week with trainers at the Y with a family member, were coached through cardio and weight machines. They developed individualized work out programs for us, and we could use the Y free for those 3 months. I qualified for a half price membership scholarship so will be continuing my exercise routine. If the program is offered in your area I'd highly recommend it, I came out so much stronger and have my stamina back.

She told me that she did not need any yet but that she could use some in kid sizes. I asked her why. Turns out a lady in the next office was trying to find a hat to fit her 4 year old daughter who is about to start chemo. I told Sherlyn that I would be glad to make hats for the lady's daughter for free. I was already working on a pink one and it would be no problem to make it small enough to fit a 4 year old. Made me a little sad that it would be for a 4 year old but happy that I could do it for her. I thought I would also make her a white one, like a sun hat and my husband suggest a furry one too. A girl can never have enough hats. Sherlyn said something about the lady saying that the hats needed to be in plastic and she had no idea what that meant but I do. I have to wash them in All Free & Clear and put them in a ziplock bag so that no germs can get on them just in case her immune system is compromised."

Monday, I was admitted to hospital again with another blood infection.  On Thursday, I was transferred via ambulance to Ochsner in New Orleans.  So far, the docs did a very specialized CT that shows very thin slices of the pancreas. The pancreatic mass is inoperable.  The doc wants to try yet another EUP (endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas)  biopsy because surgery won't be easy on me and the pancreatic problem is not fixable. My last hope is that this is somehow breast mets in which case certain meds might help. "
22178,"It has been a whirlwind start of the new year. I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the left breast on January 9th. I am scheduled for a mastectomy this Friday. I did not have any of the risk factors and was totally caught off guard. I have yet to decide what makes me more upset: having the CA, or having two lousy choices for treatment. I am not having any reconstruction. I do count myself among the lucky few. I have a wonderful support network. Every day is a challenge. I get tearful and cry at times. I am sometimes withdrawn. I told my wonderful husband that the only time I can escape this is when I am asleep. thankfully I am still able to sleep, but it does take me longer to fall asleep. So, what do I need? Has anyone not had reconstructions and lived happily without it. How have you managed the prosthesis? Does it really matter if you don't wear on all the time?

22285,"I have read so many stories of how families rally around their family member with cancer.  My situation couldn't be more different.  I feel that my family has abandoned me.  I am single and I have a mom and three older brothers.  All are local except for one brother.  When I was first diagnosed I told my brothers. The two who are local told me that I couldn't tell my mother because it would just be too much for her to handle after my Dads death a year earlier.  I could not believe what they were saying to me!  Not tell my mom?  Reluctantly I agreed to hold off on telling her until after my lumpectomy surgery when I had a definitive treatment plan.  After surgery (which I went to by myself) it was determined that I would need chemo, a mastectomy, and radiation.  In my mind, it was time to tell my mom.  I told my two local brothers that they needed to join me for the ""discussion"".  In my mind, they needed to be there for their mom.  I had to practically drag them there.  They did not want me to tell her but I had to....I was going to need help.  Although we had the discussion, my brother completely downplayed the whole thing and said that I had surgery and I was now fine.  What????  I was so stunned I couldn't say anything.  I was days from my first chemo treatment.  I left my moms house in a daze.  I started chemo a few days later.  I attended every chemo treatment by myself.  My brothers never offered to join me, never offered me help that I desperately needed.  They did nothing.  I was all alone.  There were some days during Taxol where I had really bad pain and if I had a bullet and a gun I would have used it.  I had to lie to my mother and tell her that I was traveling on business so she wouldn't call me.  I would not have been able to hide my pain in my voice.  My other brother did his best from 500 miles away.  He called all the time, sent me flowers, etc.  He and I eventually decided to tell my mom because I was going to need help after my mastectomy.  He flew into town and we told my mom.  It wasn't easy but it was finally done.  I was so bitter about my brothers behavior that I told my mom that they abandoned me...they did nothing.  My mom had a reaction that floored me...she defended them.  It was like a knife in the gut.  I could not believe what I was hearing.  Needless to say, my relationship with my family is broken.  Im wondering if I ever had one to begin with.  I would not treat a stranger the way they have treated me.  I am so hurt and so bitter.  Im crying like a baby as I write this.  Please tell me someone else has gone through this?  Please tell me I'm not the only one?"

22763,"Just joined today. I had a lumpectomy with removal of 2 sentinel lymph nodes, left breast, 8 days ago, which was 6 weeks after having rotator cuff repair surgery on the shoulder on the same side. My lymph nodes came back negative and pathology report showed margins were clear. However, because it was invasive ductal carcinoma my medical oncologist is going to run an Oncotype test to see whether I'm a low, intermediate or high risk patient. Low risk = no chemo, high risk=chemo, intermediate= we'll discuss it. So Arimidex and radiation are on hold while I wait the 2 weeks for the results. "

23713,"Hello Everyone, hope I can get some answers here, Why do ONCS tell their patients that they are cured from cancer and then put you on a hormonal, or AL drug to keep it from coming back. And then you have to keep going back so often for 5 years or more for test, I have heard that some ONCS are  putting their patients that take hormonal or Al for 10 yrs. I have read on this website and others  people are cured and within a few months or a couple of years their cancer is back. Even as much as 10 yrs. cancer is back and still related wth your Breast Cancer that you had before.  I am high risk of mine returning and on arimidex for 5 years yet I am on the arimidex to keep the cancer from coming back so HOW CAN I BE CANCER FREE AND CURED.

23717,"Yesterday, I had a Stereotactic Core Needle Biopsy - OUCH! I had a mammogram which looked suspicious, right breast only. My doctor had me go for additional mammography images and an ultrasound of my right breast. The Mammogram impression was an architectural distortion corresponding with a malignant appearing mass. Category 5-malignant features, biopsy recommended. The Ultrasound impression was a 1.2cm mass at 10 o'clock and 1.4cm mass at 11 o'clock. Category 5-malignant features, biopsy recommended. Needless to say, I made an appointment with my surgeon. The surgeon requested that I bring the films and reports from radiology with me. I did. That was yesterday morning 9:00 AM. My surgeon scheduled me immediately, the same day, for 12:30 PM to do a Stereotactic Core Needle Biopsy. To say the least, I was taken back by his urgency to do this procedure. Nonetheless, I agreed. However, I did ask for something to relax me, I was nervous. He assured me that I did not need anything, because it was relatively painless. He said I wouldn't feel a thing. I insisted, he agreed and gave me 5mg of valium 1 hour prior to the biopsy. OUCH, OUCH, OUCH! I had a terrible experience. I felt everything! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy! I am so happy that it is over. Although, I am extremely anxious about waiting until Friday (3 Days) for the results to come back from pathology. Can anyone share their experience with this procedure as I have described it? Can anyone tell me why the majority of women do not have this awful pain, yet others do? Was it my surgeon? Or perhaps the location or depth of my masses? I truly don't believe my Dr. is to blame. But, why so much pain?   "

24035,"I haven't been in for a while trying to sort things out. I had posted about having about four surgery's after August 2012 till November the fifth 2013. After taking the drains out at the end of Nov. I was drained about every week until I started my radiation treatments. I had my mastectomy the fifth of Nov. 2012 then February the fifteenth I had another surgery where the cancer came back in the incision. He said he could do no more surgery because my skin was pulled so tight that he would have to use my stomach muscles to build a chest wall and skin from my back or leg to graft skin over that. He said it was a horrible surgery and with all my medical problems he didn't want to do it. There would be nothing else they could do. It's Angiosarcoma cancer it's a rare cancer caused by the radiation I took for my cancer five years ago.

I can't get loans or them either. I just worry about there future. I am taking radiation which gave me this cancer it scares me, but the only chance I have to prolong it from coming back soon.

My left breast is considerably small as a result of radiation. If I was to get cancer in either breast again a masectomy would be necessary. Also maybe older and not as healthy.

My logical side says not to worry, but my ""feeling"" side is stronger. I hate the prosthesis, so I never wear one. My right shoulder gets sore at times, I think from the remaining breast.

24853,"So yesterday was my annual mammo, ultra-sound and visit with my breast surgeon (I am now 5.5 years out from 2 lumpectomies, 6 rounds of T/C & 33 rads being diagnosed with Stage 1, grade C, TNBC at 57). I had booked my appointment 3 weeks ago and been asked about the results from the MRI...what MRI???--nobody told me I was supposed to have one, so I kinda went into shock and didn't ask for the 3-D mammo (that costs an extra $57) that my center offers and promptly forgot about it altogether. At the appointment I saw the surgeon first, than had a fairly painful ultra-sound and then time for the mammo. After the 1st 2 plates as the tech as moving my boob around for the next 2 plates I asked, what about the 3-D? She told me that I didn't request one (although I had asked the ultra-sound tech to tell her that I wanted one). I said, yes I know I was distracted when making the appointment about an MRI. She said well, we are half way through and this is just an annual check up so she suggested I get the 3-D in 6 months. I repeated that I wanted the 3-D and her answer was, well the regular mammo finds cancer just fine. WHAT???? If that were the case, why would they have the new machine and my surgeon tell me that it is a better technology? At this point I was in tears and sobbing and I asked the tech--DOES SHE HAVE BREAST CANCER?? Realizing that I was seriously upset she got her superior who said, go ahead and give it to her, there's no problem. All of the memories came flooding back to me about what BC has taken from me. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to be healthy and alive, but I was diagnosed 4 months after getting married and it really threw me for a loop. I've lost all confidence in my body and marital intimacy is a big problem for me. I've gained weight that I can't seem to take off and my new normal isn't what it was. While this may sound trivial it was very upsetting to the point that I almost totalled my car on the drive home because I was so distracted."

I met with a surgeon and so far they will do a lumpectomy and analyze that.  They are thinking that I will need radiation for 4-6 weeks, chemo mix once a week for 12 weeks and the. Chemo every 3 weeks for a year followed by a drug for 5 years. I wrote down the chemo and drug, but don't have it handy. I really just don't think I can do it.

26018,I am asking for prayers for Dawne sweet sisters. She has been at the hospital since about 11:30 our time. She has a deep blood clot in her jugular vein. It is a very dangerous situation.

26170,"Just came from the cardiologist.  My muga scan came out in normal range.  Yet he still wants me to do a stress test, and he put me on some little pill everyday.  2.5 milligrams.  not sure what it is.  Now he wants me to do a stress test!   I AM SO PISSED.  I HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT ALL MY LIFE, NEVER HAD HIGH CHOLESTEROL COUNTS.  I WORK OUT 3- 5 TIMES A WEEK, AND I AM AN FITNESS INSTRUCTOR. "
26259,I had bilateral mastectomy in dec 2014.  Had fifteen lymph nodes removed and started reconstruction.  i have finished the aggressive chemo treatments in May and will continue herceptin til January and am still doing radiation.  I also will be taking tomoxifen for ten years.  I know after all treatments I will see my oncologist every three months for first year and so on for five years.  My question is if I will have to have a breast MRI yearly to check chest wall for recurrence.  Women who still have their breast have mamograms done. My surgeon at the beginning said I would have to but my oncologist says studies show that doing frequent scans won't improve the length of time you live. He said only if symptoms should arise of recurrence then they would.   So does anyone else have same situation and have you been told you would or wouldn't need a MRI yearly.  Thanks in advance.
26286,"Hi Ladies! I just finished my 4th and LAST round of T/C chemo 2 weeks ago. I have gotten over all side effects but one - fatigue. Before chemo, I was such a high energy person, and even exercised throughout my chemo treatments, except the day of. But after the 4th treatment, I'm very tired. Has anyone experienced this, and if so - how long does this last? My Oncologist said it could take weeks, but I spoke to another survivor who said it took her months to get her energy level back! I just started a no-animal eating plan from and after-cancer-care center, and they are monitoring my blood to see where I am deficient thanks to the chemo, I asked them about the fatigue, and they told me the same thing... it could take weeks to months. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I sleep 10 hours a night, and still need a nap around 2:00 in the afternoon. I miss my energy!"
26479,"I have just been diagnosed with breast cancer the day after my birthday,march 6. Happy Birthday to me:( I immediately started to look for research to try and find what stage i coukd be in. My MRI is scheduled for this friday,march 15 and i am so nervous! i have 4 tumors and my right lumph node under my armpit is sore and the radiologist says i will most likely need that removed. I dont have much of a family history of cancer,just my great aunt having a lump when she was in her 30s in the 1980s. she had a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery with no radiation or chemo. I pray i will not need them either,but the obgyn and radiologist seem as though i may do radiation after. I work in the skincare/ beauty industry and as terrible as it sounds,i dont want to lose my hair or go through the pain and sickness of chemo. Is there ways to go about not losing yout hair in the treatments? working in this industry of skin and hair will be so hard to deal with and goung through the thought of being diagnosed with the cancer itself has been a real shock to the system and family.

26634,"SUCH an easy travel this time! Our good friends took us all the way to Schiphol, saving us the train experience (baggage in/baggage out). Then we were pre-boarded (frequent flyer) and snagged the best overheads. Flight was good (10 hours, 25 minutes), we slept much of it, but I watched 2 movies on my in-seat screen. In L.A., my DIL was waiting for us outside baggage claim, whisking us home. House was in order, soup and bread waiting made by our housekeeper...and then off to bed, where I slept solid for 7 hours! What a grand 'Welcome home'! (Now, if I could only stop speaking Dutch to everyone....*grin*)"
26657,"NOT WHAT I wanted. Aromason has stopped working.  Will either strat on Ibrace w/Aromason...  The work together and the Aromason gives the Ibrace a boost to target the tumors.
Tumors are growing and there are many new ones mostly on the head, breastbones and right knee which was already quite full of tumors.  The tumors on t spine are stablr still (they were radiated), but the right hip to calf is much worse and the pain is bad.
Will have biopsies on 9/10 of both upper and lower intestine.  Possiblity that it is in the stomach wall.
Have decisions to make on doing more chemo as 2 1/2 years od weekly was not effective and because of all the chemo I have had, it has changed the cellular structure of the tumors so the chance of chemo being effective in stablizing the  tumorsis les than 35%.
Do I want to go thru chemo for such lw dds???  But without I have no odds, but quality of time left may be better.
Could be worse, at least my liver and lungs are clear , but have more soft  tissue tumors in arms and back.

26803,I have only posted once but have watched all the post through out my treatment.  I had my last radiation treatment last week and I am very relieved.  Went through Chemo as well but ended up allergic to it so only had 3 out of 4 of my infusions.
26912,hi everyone! i am a wife of a man who has breast cancer. He has stage 2 cancer and is scheduled for mastectomy next week. The doctors would like to take few of the muscles in the breast to make sure it hasn't spread and his doctor mentioned about removing some of his lymph nodes but we are not completely sure if that is what we want. We we're discussing about asking for a second opinion but don't know where or how to start. Is there anyone out there going through the same? Any suggestions on how we should proceed? My husband and I are optimistic about everything but it's not easy for me not to worry about him. We have been married only for a few years and the thought that i might loose him is something i'm not sure i can handle. Any help will be greatly appreaciated! Thank you. 
26930,"Hi. My mother was recently diagnosed with colon and breast cancer. She is turning 67 this April and will start her chemo as soon as she heals from her colon resection. Her medical oncologist will put her to Tamoxifen for the breast and Xeloda for the colon. I would like to know the side effects for these 2 medications if anyone here is taking them currently. Also, I heard Aromacin? is better than Tamoxifen? Is this true? A family friend of ours mentioned it to me. She said that Tamoxifen made her breast cancer moved to her uterus. My mom has already both breast and colon. I don't want anything more new for her. We all are heartbroken of this news. Please share some infos please."

Take it out and let's see what happened. I did change my diet, healthier, fruits/veggies,no bread,little dairy,minimal meat. My back was hurting in the fall,so an xray was done. 2 lesions were seen on my lungs,and one on my spine. I did nothing. This spring, I went back to my dr. Backache was back. He ordered an MRI,but laughed at me for wanting another mammo to ""check"". It was like Why bother,if you won't follow up on the lesions in your lungs?? The back MRI showed benign tumors on my spine. The mammo showed tumors in my breast,2,same spot as last year only smaller,under a cm each. I had those removed a few weeks ago."
27007,"I am seeing a plastic surgeon this week to discuss reconstruction after having a mastectomy, chemo and radiation a year ago.  I would prefer to use my own tissue rather than an implant because I feel that the implant side will feel different than my remaining breast, and I have come to understand that using an implant under radiated tissue isn't preferred by physicians."

My husband's co worker and friend passed away from cancer.Started in his stomach not long after I was dx.So it's been 3 years for him.He had pneumonia in Oct and they found it had spread.Just the other day when he and I were talking,we  laughed and laughed that day ribbing my husband. My husband goes with me to feed stray cats in different areas every night.Now most men wont do that.Anyway my husband, me and this guy got close the last few months. My husband  got his tools from work and was taking them to him weekly. Our  friend  had a hard time getting around.He asked my husband about a ramp.If the weather was  warmer my husband would do it. We  wanted him to get around.Sunday my husband took him some tools.As my husband left he bent over to  hug his friend.His friend said LOVE YOU MAN. It upset my husband.Since he thinks now his friend knew. Our friend fell Monday and Tues.I was going on line to find a group to pay and help put up  a ramp for him.He knew the cost but had no money  since off work. The guys wife told my husband  Monday  she needed help.We were going to help with the ramp so he could do treatment.These were  treatments my husband made possible.My husband had  called work when he found out the guy was denied chemo through our insurance.My husband got in touch with Patient Relations.They got on it and the same day the insurance OK'd his treatment. I think the falls he had the last 2 days  just were to much.I'm sure he hurt himself and one fall he laid on the cold wet ground for 20 minutes before their neighbor came home to help him up. His wife and daughter couldn't lift him."

27245,"Well, I'm back again with more confusing news. Back story: DCIS 2008 bilateral mastectomy and latissimus flap reconstruction. No treatment since it wasn't invasive. Found lump in axilla in June 2016. DX August 5 with IDC. Started Femara in August. MRI in December showed tumor shrinkage on largest . MRI in August had shown slightly less than 2cm. December MRI showed slightly less than 1cm. At surgery 2/21/17 it was actually 2cm. . I had a smaller tumor (8mm) on medial side of same breast. Decided on total mastectomy on right side. I saw my MO today and got my surgical pathology report. My biopsy path report showed ER+PR+HER2-, but surgical path report says ER+PR+ HER2 unequivocal. I had a repeat mastectomy, which removed my reconstructed breast including the flap and implant from 2008. They took 23 nodes/1 positive with no vascular invasion. We are waiting on the FISH test for the HER2. MO is now saying she recommends chemo after all but is going to wait on fish test and even then It's still up to me. I'm so confused as I thought with the oncotype dx score 12 on biopsy tissue, I was good to go on just Femara. Seems now chemo is back on the table and I have to decide. The side effects scare me really bad but if it's needed I want to be sure I do all I can to beat this this time around. Anyone with a low oncotype score (12) but node involvement?  Did you do chemo anyway? "

I went to my onc today to see if the Letrozole is causing this pain.  She advised me to go off AI for 3 weeks and to also get an MRI of lower back.  I won't lie, this makes me nervous and fearful for recurrence of secondary cancer.  When I told family and best friend, they all act like it is no big deal and that I should be done with cancer....they have MOVED ON and I'm still dealing with daily trying to get back into some sort of life post cancer treatment.  My friend actually said, ""I don't want to hear it!"" and changed the subject.  Anyone else ever had this reaction from family and friends?"

I ordered one awhile back when I went in for some outpatient surgery, and, I just went to the site and ordered another pink one.

Can anyone come and talk to me, what's your advice? I can't ever have radiation again on the same breast so readiation is out, so then what will they do....make me have a mastectomy this time around?

I did not have any of the risk factors and was totally caught off guard. I have yet to decide what makes me more upset: having the CA, or having two lousy choices for treatment. I am not having any reconstruction. I do count myself among the lucky few. I have a wonderful support network. Every day is a challenge. I get tearful and cry at times. I am sometimes withdrawn. I told my wonderful husband that the only time I can escape this is when I am asleep. thankfully I am still able to sleep, but it does take me longer to fall asleep. So, what do I need? Has anyone not had reconstructions and lived happily without it. How have you managed the prosthesis? Does it really matter if you don't wear on all the time? Has anyone had back problems from being lopsided? thanks in advance."

Just wondering what your experiences has been with the loss of other hair.  Does it all come out at the same time? Should I expect the loss of my eyebrows and lashes for the during of chemo?  I hear so much about hair loss, wigs and scrafs, but not much about what to do about the loss of other hair. I know we're all different, but it's GREAT to hear your experiences and to gather info.

My pet scan showed the cancer is multiplying all over my bones :-(
From there they wanted an MRI of my brain. . Not so good there either, and now I'm really really really scared.
The scan showed one tumor in the right superior temporal, whatever that is, all I heard was ""mets to your brain""
I don't know where to go from here, I'm just sick over it all. I see my palliative care doc tomorrow to set up some hard stuff :(
I see a radiologist Wednesday

30712,"I saw my oncologist Tuesday to go over the results of the PET scan. My day actually started with a very urgent sounding lady from the lab insisting I get a hold of my provider immediately. Evidently she didn't realize this was blood work ordered by my oncologist as it seems my tumor markers were way elevated. (7. something)
I had been concerned about a muscle spasm in my right back and hoped it wouldn't light up like Times Square on the scan. I'd had this problem since early April and I thought it was from my new keyboard.
After getting the results yesterday I now know what I'm facing and it's not good. Evidently I have 2 spots on my spine (T2 and T9) as well as mets to the 12th rib. So the pain wasn't a muscle spasm at all but bone mets.
I was to have my port installed yesterday morning but the imaging machine at the hospital went on the fritz and I've still heard nothing about rescheduling.
I will be starting 6 rounds of CMF (Cytoxan, Methotrexate and Fluorouracil) probably next week. Not sure what the prognosis is for the bone mets but I've heard not so good.
Anyone else dealt with this?

Also - should I explore other options (I just read about ovary removal on another site - my ONC and I did not even discuss this).  My ONKA score was a 12 (8% chance of recurrance) so I am tempted to just skip the hormone therapy but I am only 42 so I have a long time to get a recurrance ....

Tumors are growing and there are many new ones mostly on the head, breastbones and right knee which was already quite full of tumors.  The tumors on t spine are stablr still (they were radiated), but the right hip to calf is much worse and the pain is bad.
Will have biopsies on 9/10 of both upper and lower intestine.  Possiblity that it is in the stomach wall.
Have decisions to make on doing more chemo as 2 1/2 years od weekly was not effective and because of all the chemo I have had, it has changed the cellular structure of the tumors so the chance of chemo being effective in stablizing the  tumorsis les than 35%.
Do I want to go thru chemo for such lw dds???  But without I have no odds, but quality of time left may be better.
Could be worse, at least my liver and lungs are clear , but have more soft  tissue tumors in arms and back.

I had my mastectomy the fifth of Nov. 2012 then February the fifteenth I had another surgery where the cancer came back in the incision. He said he could do no more surgery because my skin was pulled so tight that he would have to use my stomach muscles to build a chest wall and skin from my back or leg to graft skin over that. He said it was a horrible surgery and with all my medical problems he didn't want to do it. There would be nothing else they could do.

32907,Has anyone had heart problems after treatment with Adriamycin?  We are told it can damage the heart but there don't seem to be many details available.  I went through numerous heart tests 4 years ago when I experienced chest pain.  I never got an answer to what I was experiencing.  The cardiologist said there were minor abnormalities but there was no follow up. I was put on Atenolol but went off of it when my heart rate dropped too low.  My own conclusion is that it was perhaps caused by lymphatic fluid build up from physical exertion.  Now I am experiencing an irregular heartbeat and am going for an EKG.  Just curious if anyone knows what kind of heart problems are attributed to chemo.

33967,"Well I bought a bike. I first got one from Walmart. It was a 26"" Schwinn 7 Speed Cruiser bike. Well it was too big for me and I fell off the bike into the yard, just getting on it. Bruised me up but I still wanted a bike. I took that bike back and started hunting for a local bike shop. I also did a lot of research online and figured out that I needed a bike with a small step through frame. I thought about an adult trike but I wanted something with gears. Well I found a 7 speed bike in a local bike shop that I kind a liked but it did not have fenders. I asked the salesman if I could add fenders and he said yes. So I bought the bike. Well it has been 50 years since I rode a bike. I tried riding in the yard, still afraid of falling off and busting my noggin. I could do it but not really well. So I did more research and found some adult training wheels (they are called bike stabilizers when they are for adults). Yea for me and my noggin. Well it took me a day to get those stabilizers on my bike but they are on there now. I rode around the block 3 times. The fenders are supposed to arrive on Saturday.

34107,Saw my onc on Friday and got my pathology after mastectomy in December.  My onco score was 20 so he decided on no chemo...and i was Her2 negative but highly HR positive.  I have my Arimidex but I am scared to start it for fear of side effects so I am giving myself the weekend for a little break and then I will start.  Reading this forum I see people referring to generic.....I never thought to ask if that was my prescription.......thanks will check that out.....wondering if makes a big difference?  
34238,"I saw my oncologist Tuesday to go over the results of the PET scan. My day actually started with a very urgent sounding lady from the lab insisting I get a hold of my provider immediately. Evidently she didn't realize this was blood work ordered by my oncologist as it seems my tumor markers were way elevated. (7. something)
I had been concerned about a muscle spasm in my right back and hoped it wouldn't light up like Times Square on the scan. I'd had this problem since early April and I thought it was from my new keyboard.
After getting the results yesterday I now know what I'm facing and it's not good. Evidently I have 2 spots on my spine (T2 and T9) as well as mets to the 12th rib. So the pain wasn't a muscle spasm at all but bone mets.
I was to have my port installed yesterday morning but the imaging machine at the hospital went on the fritz and I've still heard nothing about rescheduling.
I will be starting 6 rounds of CMF (Cytoxan, Methotrexate and Fluorouracil) probably next week. Not sure what the prognosis is for the bone mets but I've heard not so good.
Anyone else dealt with this?

34315,"After being diagnosed, we all wonder how we could ""get"" breast cancer. Both myself, and my ""Breast Friend,"" had surgery the same day. We were both diagnosed with same stage, node neg, estrogen positive tumors. After some conversation, we both realized we'd been wearing heart-rate monitors for the previous two years. We both ate healthier than any ""post-cancer"" diet we've seen and worked out 4-6 days a week. I have scoured the internet and literature looking for any studies, correlations, or info on the relation of breast cancer and heart-rate monitors. I see a lot of men wearing these, which could potentially explain their risk. These are the monitors that come in two pieces. One piece straps around your chest, running directly under your breasts, and the second piece is your wristwatch. It receives the signal from the strap around your chest and turns it into real-time data. "
34347,"I completed treatment (bilateral lumpectomies, chemo, and radiation) at the end of 2009.  I'm on Tamoxifen and have some (manageable) side effects from that, but thankfully, I'm healthy now and continue to have good checkups and boring mammograms."
34572,"Hi all. Starting radiation today and I'm just a little puzzled about what to wear if/when my skin starts to burn. I saw something about plain white t-shirts, which I bought. But having had a lumpectomy, I still have to hold up the breasts I have left! The radiation nurse said that anything constricting and rubbing the skin will be uncomforable. That's kind of the definition of a bra even non-underwire bras. Any suggestions or advice on what you did would be greatly appreciated."

34772,"I just had a double masectomy last Thursday and seemed to be recovering nicely.  I went in yesterday for my pathology report and of course didn't get the news I'd hoped for.   I will have to undergo another surgery on one of my breast next week to take additional skin off due to the cancer spreading along the skin tissue.  This wasn't found until after the inital surgery.  They also found the cancer in my lymph nodes only one out of five but now the doc states chemo will be desired.  They will be taking the muscle and skin from my back to fill in the breast.  It seems like every time I take one step forward for recovery I get hit with bad news about the cancer and seems to go back.  The first surgery was hard enough, I just started showering and getting dressed by myself.  Sorry ladies just having a pity party!!!  I know I need to go and get it out of me and continue on with treatment...just having one of those days!  "

35391,"Hey all and thanks for reading what I am about to put. I am new to this board. I have had a lymph node under my left arm swelling up for the past 2 years. It will swell up and go down some (put you can still see puffiness under my arm). When it is swollen it's so sore and it seems so raw. I have to hold hot wash clothes to it for it to feel some better. I have finally got insurance and have went to the breast clinic. The lady that was doing my mammogram she asked me where was my problem and I raised my arm and she seen it right away. She did get a picture of it so they could see it. She told me I would be called back and I have been. I was called back and they told me they did see the place under my arm and they have seen something in my right breast also. They said it was a spot in my right breast and my right breast was extremly smaller than my left breast the one I am having trouble from. I have had a polyp in my colon that was stage 1 cancer, so I am having some of the worse thoughts you all can probably imagen. I am 37 and not in the best health anyway. My mom, grandmother, and 11 of my grandmother's sister has all had cancer and 75% of their daughters and their daughters have. So I truly am expecting that they will tell me I have breast cancer. I am scared that I have waited to long too. I have already told my husband even if I don't have breast cancer I want a double masectomy because I already know I have the cancer gen in my body and my mom's side of the family is full with breast cancer. I am so scared, I can't even put it in words. I have 2 kids 7 and 13 and I can't imagen leaving them and my husband. I am a Christian and I am saved by the grace of God but I am still scared. Can anyone tell me what yall think. I feel so stupid writing on here, but I thought it may help me. I am praying for you all on here! Love in Christ, Amanda"

Why can't people understand that I don't think I can go back to the old me, that I have changed, and probably not in a good way for now.  I finished rads just a few months ago and I still feel lost.  I still feel like I am kind of in a queary as to how do I forget about a recurrence, how do I just not think of my bc everyday.  How do I not look at her or any of my other girlfriends and just say why, why me.  Guess I am just feeling a little down and like others on here, needed to write this down.  I will get past this, it just upset me that she thought I can go back to how I was before my bc, because I can't, no matter how hard I try.  Thanks for reading this."
35879,"Circulating cell-free DNA carrying tumor-specific alterations (circulating tumor DNA) is more effective at monitoring metastatic breast cancer than current biomarkers approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and circulating tumor cells, according to a proof-of-concept study.The study, led by Sarah-Jane Dawson, PhD, from the University of Cambridge and the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, in the United Kingdom, was published online today in the New England Journal of Medicine.""Metastatic breast cancer is incurable but treatable with serial administration of endocrine, cytotoxic, or biologic therapies,"" Carlos Caldas, MD, also from the University of Cambridge and one of the study authors, told Medscape Medical News.Monitoring treatment response is essential and can be carried out with biomarkers such as cancer antigen (CA) 15-3 and circulating tumor cells, using the CellSearch (Veridex) test, but we are seeking better biomarkers, Dr. Caldas said.""Effectively, genomics provides a new type of very specific biomarker for monitoring tumors in response to therapy. In other words, the mutations that each tumor accumulates are an individual genomic 'barcode' that we can then use to monitor tumor burden and response to treatment,"" he explained.The researchers used targeted or whole-genome sequencing to identify somatic genomic alterations, and designed personalized assays to quantify circulating tumor DNA in serially collected plasma specimens. They also measured CA 15-3 levels and numbers of circulating tumor cells at identical time points.They found that circulating tumor DNA was superior to the other 2 blood tests. Circulating tumor DNA was successfully detected in 29 of the 30 women (97%) with metastatic breast cancer receiving systemic therapy in whom somatic genomic alterations were identified. In comparison, CA 15-3 was detected in 21 of 27 women (78%) and circulating tumor cells were detected in 26 of 30 women (87%).In addition to its superior sensitivity in detecting metastatic breast cancer, circulating tumor DNA had a greater dynamic range, which correlated with changes in tumor burden. The test also provided the earliest measure of treatment response in 10 of the 30 women tested, Dr. Caldas said.He added that most laboratories equipped to do molecular testing can do this test using circulating tumor DNA; however, these are usually only located in major tertiary care centers.""I think this...will be a landmark report, and circulating tumor DNA is going to be one of the highlights in medicine in 2013. The test will definitely be used in clinical research immediately, although generic use in cancer patients will have wait until diagnostic companies release tests for use,"" Dr. Caldas said.In a press release issued by Cancer Research UK, which funded the study in part, chief clinician Peter Johnson, MD, was quoted as saying: ""These results hold the promise of a system that could allow us to modify someone's treatment as their cancer changes, and they suggest an exciting way to quickly get hold of the personal details of a cancer, to target it for the most effective therapy.""""One of the things that will help our scientists design better cancer treatments is a way of measuring early on which ones are working and which are not. If we can find the molecular footprints of cancers during treatment and see how they change, we hope we will be able to track them down and remove them much more efficiently,"" he added.Approach Has ""Remarkable Potential""In an accompanying editorial, Marc Lippman, MD, from the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Florida, and C. Kent Osborne, MD, from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, agree that this test has definite possibilities.There is remarkable potential for this approach, they write, but they also list some concerns.""All patients with breast cancer have mutations in their tumor DNA, but without very intensive sequencing strategies, a specific probe or probes for each patient may remain elusive or very costly,"" and a standard 'panel' is unlikely to work for all patients,"" Drs. Lippman and Osborne write.Also, the number of patients in whom an objective response to treatment was seen in circulating tumor DNA was limited, so the ""laudable effort"" to compare the usefulness of circulating tumor DNA with circulating tumor cells and measures of CA 15-3 ""was more encouraging than definitive.""The editorialists conclude that this study provides proof of the concept that circulating tumor DNA is ""a sensitive biomarker of tumor burden,"" and add that studies showing that it can be used to improve the care of patients with metastatic breast or even other cancers ""in a cost-effective manner"" are needed.The study was supported by Cancer Research UK, the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, the National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, and by an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council R.G.

35971,"Robert A. Nagourney, M.D.The term “triple negative breast cancer” (TNBC) is applied to a subtype of breast cancers that do not express the estrogen or progesterone receptors. Nor do they overexpress the HER2 gene. This disease constitutes 15 – 20 percent of all breast cancers and has a predisposition for younger women, particularly those of black and Hispanic origin. This disease may becoming more common; although, this could reflect the greater awareness and recognition of this disease as a distinct biological entity.On molecular profiling, TNBC has distinct features on heat maps. The usual hormone response elements are deficient, while a number of proliferation markers are upregulated. Not surprisingly, this disease does not respond to the usual forms of therapy like Tamoxifen and the other selective estrogen response modifiers known as SERMs. Nonetheless, TNBC can be quite sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Indeed, the responsiveness to chemotherapy can provide these patients with complete remissions. Unfortunately, the disease can recur. Complete remission maintained over the first three to five years is associated with a favorable prognosis, with recurrence rates diminishing over time and late recurrences more often seen in estrogen receptor-positive cancers.Triple negative breast cancer is not one, but many diseases.Among the subtypes are those that respond to metabolic inhibitors such as the PI3K and mTOR directed drugs. Another subset may respond to drugs that target epidermal growth factor. There are basal-types that may be somewhat more refractory to therapy, while a subset may have biology related to the BRCA mutants, characterized by DNA repair deficiencies and exquisite sensitivity to Cisplatin-based therapies. Finally, a last group is associated with androgen signaling and may respond to drugs that target the androgen receptor.Some years ago, we used the EVA-PCD platform to study refractory patients with breast cancer and identified exquisite sensitivity to the combination of Cisplatin plus Gemcitabine in this patient group. We published our observations in the Journal of Clinical Oncology and the combination of Cisplatin or Carboplatin plus Gemcitabine has become an established part of the armamentarium in these patients.http://www.rationaltherapeutics.com/downloads/pdfs/Gemcitabine_Plus_Cisplatin-Breast.pdfThe I-SPY-2 trial has now used genomic analyses confirming our observations for the role of platins in TNBC. This is part reflects the DNA repair deficiency subtype associated with the BRCA-like biology. More recently, we have examined TNBC patients for their sensitivity to novel therapeutic interventions. Among them, the PI3K and mTOR inhibitors, as well as the glucose metabolism pathway inhibitors like Metformin. Additional classes of drugs that are revealing activity are the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, some of which are moving forward through clinical trials.One feature of triple negative breast cancer is avid uptake on PET scan. This reflects, in part, the proliferation rate of these tumors, but may also reflect metabolic changes associated with altered glucose metabolism. In this regard, the use of drugs that change mitochondrial function may be particularly active. Metformin, a member of the biguanide family influences mitochondrial metabolism at the level of AMP kinase. The activity of Metformin and related classes of drugs in triple negative breast cancer is a fertile area of investigation that we and others are pursuing.When we examine the good response of many triple negative breast cancers to appropriately selected therapies, the potential for durable complete remissions and the distinctly different biology that TNBC represents, the question arises whether TNBC is actually a worse diagnosis, or simply a different entity that requires different thinking. We have been very impressed by the good outcome of some of our triple negative breast cancer patients and believe this a very fertile area for additional investigation."

Said I would need a mammo in 2 weeks.  2 DAYS later, the hospital phones and says I am getting an ultrasound instead.  Tech was a cow.  Before she scanned me, she scolded me for being there, told me she could 'guarantee' normal breast tissue.  Literally almost said, eff it, and left (felt dumb for wasting everyone's time) but then she scanned it.  Well, part of it.  Found 2 cysts and a 'hard mass tumour' which they wanted to biopsy, but didn't because I panicked and wouldn' let them (I know, I am an idiot).  The radiologist said ""i can't ignore it"" and to see my doctor within 2 days, but of course, I can't get in right away, so I go this Friday to my GP.  Here is the thing, I have a needle phobia...not a fear, but phobia that sends me into full-on panic attacks.  I have had three babies, all sctions, and the worst part was the needles, so please go easy on me....but, I am looking for gentle advic on what to do here.  I have heard that a biopsy can 'seed' the breast with cancer and right now it is 'encapsulated'.  I am terrified, yes, in denial with age and breastfeeding (I am currently breastfeeding) on my side...but I have 3 small children...my youngest, 1 years old....so, feeling very scared, bewildered, and I don't have nyone to turn to who has 'been there'....two aunties, that have died.

Can anyone come and talk to me, what's your advice? I can't ever have radiation again on the same breast so readiation is out, so then what will they do....make me have a mastectomy this time around? How will my skin hold up, I though skin that's been radiated cannot have any surgeries after the fact cause the skin won't heal well, how would I have a double mastectomy now?

I really appreciated Eric, in that he always, always, made sure that I was decent during my treatment and set up.  Just the simple fact that he would pull my gown over my unradiated side if it slipped.  It just meant a lot, since I am rather private about such things.  Its the little things that help make this hard journey more bearable.  Saw my radiation oncologist today too, and she was all smiles and told me how get the little clear circles stickers that covered the markings for my boost off. She said it would pull my skin off if I did not use lots of aquaphor.  Well, she was right.

37127,"Well I had another PET scan on Friday because my new onc wasn't happy with the MRI and wanted to make sure I was really in remission.  MRI showed old stuff in liver that my ""old"" onc thought was nothing.  He said some residual scarring would always be there.  However, I was glad to get the PET to make sure. "
37142,A late and kind of crazy late night discharge last night - home at 9:30 PM.  I am home on TPN/lipids/insulin - all via my port to strengthen me up for my upcoming battle.  I see the onc on Thursday and my biopsy should be back then.
37203,"Hi Sisters in Pink,
     Tomorrow I go for round four of chemo and as most of you know I don't do we'll with it. After my last round I am really dreading going tomorrow and being so sick again. I am worried that like last time I will end up again in the hospital with problems breathing and wish this was just all over.
I would like to request the pink bus because I need all you strong incredible women by my side tomorrow to give me the courage and strength I need to get through yet another horrible round.  You are all truly my inspiration through this journey and don't know how I would of ever gotten this far without all of you so thank you so much!
Lots of hugs

I stay in touch with her Mom and she is doing better, has been traveling some and loves doing that. I am doing well, had my routine 6 mos check up in July, 4 years and all is well! I am very grateful for that! We are hot and dry in my part of Texas but not as bad as usual for this time of the year so cant complain. Prayers for you all"

37353,"It breaks my heart to have to post this.  My name is Jennifer Satterwhite.  My mother, Ellen Kinnamont (MommaEllen) went to be with Jesus on February 16th.  Throughout the month of January she continued to get weaker and weaker.  I won't go into the details of her struggle at the end.  Quite frankly, I lived it daily and can not bear to relive it now.  You should know that my mother was a fighter to the very end.  We were told on February 8th that she wasn't going to make it through the night.  She lasted a whole extra week!  That week she spent mostly coming in and out of conscience.  At one point she woke up and i asked her how she was feeling.  Her responce, ""With my fingers!"".  I laughed through my tears.  A few days later she woke and gave me the biggest smile when i told her i loved her!  She was my best friend and a fighter all her life.  i am so blessed to have been her caretaker.  Such valuable time given to us! "
37480,"I have read so many stories of how families rally around their family member with cancer.  My situation couldn't be more different.  I feel that my family has abandoned me.  I am single and I have a mom and three older brothers.  All are local except for one brother.  When I was first diagnosed I told my brothers. The two who are local told me that I couldn't tell my mother because it would just be too much for her to handle after my Dads death a year earlier.  I could not believe what they were saying to me!  Not tell my mom?  Reluctantly I agreed to hold off on telling her until after my lumpectomy surgery when I had a definitive treatment plan.  After surgery (which I went to by myself) it was determined that I would need chemo, a mastectomy, and radiation.  In my mind, it was time to tell my mom.  I told my two local brothers that they needed to join me for the ""discussion"".  In my mind, they needed to be there for their mom.  I had to practically drag them there.  They did not want me to tell her but I had to....I was going to need help.  Although we had the discussion, my brother completely downplayed the whole thing and said that I had surgery and I was now fine.  What????  I was so stunned I couldn't say anything.  I was days from my first chemo treatment.  I left my moms house in a daze.  I started chemo a few days later.  I attended every chemo treatment by myself.  My brothers never offered to join me, never offered me help that I desperately needed.  They did nothing.  I was all alone.  There were some days during Taxol where I had really bad pain and if I had a bullet and a gun I would have used it.  I had to lie to my mother and tell her that I was traveling on business so she wouldn't call me.  I would not have been able to hide my pain in my voice.  My other brother did his best from 500 miles away.  He called all the time, sent me flowers, etc.  He and I eventually decided to tell my mom because I was going to need help after my mastectomy.  He flew into town and we told my mom.  It wasn't easy but it was finally done.  I was so bitter about my brothers behavior that I told my mom that they abandoned me...they did nothing.  My mom had a reaction that floored me...she defended them.  It was like a knife in the gut.  I could not believe what I was hearing.  Needless to say, my relationship with my family is broken.  Im wondering if I ever had one to begin with.  I would not treat a stranger the way they have treated me.  I am so hurt and so bitter.  Im crying like a baby as I write this.  Please tell me someone else has gone through this?  Please tell me I'm not the only one?"

37522,After talking with my oncologist and finding out that my mets on my liver and spine are still growing I talked with my kids and we made the decison to stop treatments and call in hospice.  The chemo was doimg more harm than good.  Due to the mets on my spine I am unable to walk without a walker and I have been told that it is going to get sorse.  My bedroom has been moved to the living room due to the fact that I cant walk up the 12 steps.  Although I do not go out much I am able to make it down the 3 steps on the porch with help.  This was one of the toughest decisions that I have ever made in my life.

From finding lump to mastectomy as only been less than a month, still have not wrapped head around finding lump much less anything else, plus i've been blessed to have kept my drain in my cancerous breast to date, keeps draining, this is becoming wearisome. Im not here to whine but i need imput, my oncotype score was 13 which was good, i had stage I grade III invasive ductile cancer, my lymph nodes where clean but my margins were not, i opted for a double, having no issues with the noncancerous side. I was started on Arimidex 2 weeks ago, i am 58 and been post menopausal for 22 years.  I have just started having ""blinking"" hot flashes, seems they never stop, mood swings are becoming worse, I don't even like me, im just a ball of emotions, plus for some reason i look pregnant, i was as my momma always said, ""pleasing plump"", but did not go in looking like i was 8 months along, i look, feel like a mess.  I don't know what to expect next. Bless my husbands heart, he thinks that since i don't have to have IV chemo that im cured of my cancer, i know that im not, going to have a sit down with oncologist to help clarify and explain things better, like i said, it has been too fast and too much to take in. I just need to hear from others what to expect and not feel so uninformed. Please someone help me."
37798,"I didnt get a chance to come back in after my last post. I have been feeling really bad weak and sleepy. I lost a great lady my cousins daughter , Her mother was like my sister and her daughter like one of my own. She was killed in a car wreck night before last. Her last message to me was don't give up fight the cancer and let no one say they can;t fund it, because I worked hard until I became sick. She worked in a hospital and said she would check on a pet scan and other things for me. That was the night before she had the accident, she never had a chance to message me back. So today the hospital called and said my cancer was definatly back. The last thre days have been awful.  I guess the next thing is a pet scan and talk to a plastic surgeon. I have been fighting this cancer from August 2012 to  now and not sure how much longer.  The first cancer was six years ago, this cancer is from the radiatipn six years ago.

We got some fabulous pictures and movies which I will share when we get them up on the computer.  Upstate NY is beautiful in the fall and the leaves in the Adirondacks are absolutely brilliant right now.  I felt really good during the trip, but there was a lot of relaxing going on.  Mom used to be a big-time shopaholic, but now, since she's 88, with CHF and really bad arthritis, there is a lot of marathon QVC shopping going on in that house!

Left side was removed in March because the expander was coming out. I am afraid the right side is so thin it could do the same. I am having a hysterectomy this summer first, this is my priority! PS suggested a latissimus dorsi on the left because if the thin skin. I am so tired of surgery. My husband told me to take out the right so we can just enjoy our lives. I am truly blessed to have such a wonderful man in my life!

38939,"How about a courtesy knock before entering the exam room?  Almost universally, all medical staff will give a short courtesy knock prior to entering the exam room.

The NP is everything the doctor isn't...except I've noticed that he doesn't do these two things."
39005,"Just wanted to let you know a couple of things that snuck up on me out of the blue that i was not aware of.  One morning I woke and did not even recognize myself because my face was so swollen, eyes were slits.  It was more like puffy, than swollen.  Well anyway, i found out that I had a reaction to the steroid Decadron that I get with chemo, so they had to lower the dosage.  So, now my face is a little puffy after chemo but not too bad.  The next thing that happened was i got my first UTI (urinary tract infection) ever.  But, of course, i thought i was in kidney and liver failure because i did not know what was going on.  It hurt so bad to pee, and there was blood in my urine.  I gave my pee sample and was put on an anti-biotic, and within 24 hrs all was well.  The nurse told me that chemo kills the good bacteria or something like that and a UTI can occur.  Geesh!  I did not see that coming.  just wondering if this happened to anyone else, or maybe you could share one of your side effects, besides the obvious such as hair loss.  Gotta love it."

I am terrified of getting my hopes up that I will be free (hopefully long term).... Many think I should be so happy, so excited, celebrating. But...I can't seem to allow myself to really believe. Just about 2 months ago I had a PET scan and it came back clear; I was happy, relieved, excited and then....I had redness, heat, swelling in same breast as my lumpectomy.  I had to have another biospy. I thought this is it, if its back, cancer is what will kill me.  Biopsy came back negative. I know I have a lot to be thankful for and that I am blessed but.....

39287,"So my mom is 51 and she has had breast cancer since 2001. the cancer metastasized to her lungs about 6 years ago, and we recently found out that it is now in her brain. She had a total of 7 tumors, and they removed one. Since August 1st she has been in the hospital 3 times. The first time they did an emergency surgery to remove the 1 tumor. Then she did WBRT for about three weeks one treatment every day (except for the weekends of course). But then she started throwing up again and she fainted so I called 911 and they took her to the hospital and by the time I got there she was almost in a coma and they had to put her on a ventilator and all of it was caused by to much spinal fluid build up. So they put a permanent brain shunt in. So she came home (she lives with me, my husband and children) , and of course this whole time she has been taking a break from radiation. But she is VERY mean, and she basically acts like she has the beginning stages of dementia. So basically her personality has completely changed and she doesn't act like my mom anymore. And none of the mess she is taking should do that to her. And before they put the shunt in she was NOT like that. But anyway, this past Sunday she fainted again so of course I called 911 and they took her to the hospital, and it all happened again. She had to have a ventilator put in and she was Basically unconscious. This time though, the doctors don't know why it happened. her shunt was working properly, no fluid build up, the masses haven't grown, everything looked ""normal"". But she's awake now and her personality I still the same, she's very mean. And she's very difficult to take care of because of that. "

Will she have to go through chemo again ?  The Surgon wouldn't answer the question when I asked him and just said we have to wait until the path report comes back..  Any one out there have a similar experiance, Positive lymph nodes found AFTER chemo?

39443,"I had a lumpectomy this past April and had three lymph nodes taken out. The lymph nodes were fine. The cancerous lump was around 1"" in size and was a triple positive. After a bunch of research and a divine encounter I said NO to radiation and NO to chemo. The doctors wanted me to do chemo for 12 rounds. I started seeing a Naturopath and a Nutrionist. The Naturopath told me that every woman she was treating was deficient in Vitamin D and for me to get that level checked. Turns out I too was Vit D deficient. A lack of Vit D has been linked to cancer including increasing the risk of aggressive cancers. Being deficient in Iodine and Vit E is also linked to breast cancers. In addition to checking my vitamins and minerals I started to eat a more vegetable diet and stayed away from foods that would contribute to the positive proteins. "
39495,"Many of you dont know me, but the oldtimers should remember me, I have not been to the site in quite a while. I am sorry to say I am here for selfish reasons. I was diagnosed with stage 4 metastic breast cancer last year, it has gone to my bones and liver. Last week after a year of treatment the doctor used the word terminal when refering to my cancer. I mean i knew being stage 4 that it was terminal and all but hearing it out loud kind of through me for a loop. I do NOT have a time limit at this time (Thank God) the chemo is doing its job, and I dont really feel all that bad considering I have been doing chemo for a year now and will continue to do it for the rest of my life.

39547,"I'm new to this so please bear with me...  I know that tissue expanders are only meant to stretch the skin/muscle and in no way touted to look like natural breast.  But, with that said, will there be more projection as there are more fills?  I had my BMX 2/17 and expanders placed 5/17 (200ccs at time of surgery).  I've had three 100cc fills (every two weeks) and am now up to 500ccs with another scheduled next week.  I keep waiting on projection although I understand it won't be like natural breast.  My expanders are Mentor TEXP140RH.  I'm thinking I have 2-3 more fills to go but I'm not sure if I'll be able to go as far as I want.  This last fill (my third 100cc fill) has remained uncomfortable after a week out and it seemed more painful going in.  I have not had radiation and only (Thank God) taking Tamoxifen instead of traditional chemo. I'm just concerned that everything seems so flat and spread out under my arms and is tender and uncomfortable.  Any advice?"

I'm going through radiation again and I just can't get myself together. My husband is not supportive at all. He thinks he is. The only thing he does is hugs me when I cry. If I say I'm tired he says so am I. He expected my to make dinner the whole time through chemo and he is doing the same thing with radiation. I have developed somewhat of a backbone and told him that things are going to have to change. I feel stuck and alone. I looked for all of the support groups available at the hospital where I'm being treated but they only offer them once a month at a inconvenient time. I found about this site and thought it would help me. I really don't know how it works but I just know I need someone to be able to talk to that understands."
40048,"I don't have a diagnosis yet but could use some advice, input from anyone who has experienced these symptoms! I have been posting on the head and neck due to some issues with blocked nasal passage, pain, headaches,swelling,sore throat ect. See ENT next week. But to put everyone into focus, I have been diagnosed with Costochondritis aprox. 1 1/2 yrs. ago. I have had OMT and PT with no improvement in symptoms. The pain seem to have started in the right side and I said from the beginning that I didn't know whether it was my chest or breast? Doc did nuclear bone scan and tumor marker which came back clear and diagnosed Costochondritis. Long story short and the reason I am on this board today, I have had significant pain pariculary in my right breast, underarm area. I had a recent mammo and it was literally excruciating! I have very dense breasts and was called back 2 yrs, ago. I have never had a mammo that caused that much pain. Pain started before mammo btw, but just heightened with mammo. It has been continous now and causes me to wake up through the night. It is a steady pain and moderate level and that is with a pain med. No redness or other abnormalities that I can see. I turn 52 this wknd. I saw PCP today and requested a bilateral ultrasound. He agreed and I am scheduled May 7th. I can't help but be concerned where this pain has gone on for so long. My question is has anyone had such pain with their diagnosis of breast cancer? I am sorry this post is so long but had to explain the background as well. I have been hoping all this time the Doc's were right about the Costo DX however have always questioned it in my mind as it was always more pronounced in the right side! Now, I'm certain of this breast pain and obviously can't wait for the ultrasound. Any info, advice would be greatly appreciated. Please bear in mind I have very dense breasts. I don't understand why they just don't automatcially do an ultrasound with mammo for this issue? I so would appreciate any help! Thank you so much in advance and God bless all! I currently have a dear friend fighting breast cancer but she found a lump and pain wasn't a prominent feature at the time! Thank you again!"
40061,"Hi PinK:  Some years back you replied to my question on what to do about excruciating pain from lymph node removal.  ""Post Breast Therapy Pain Syndrome"" what a nice name, no solution.  Aftermonths and months of bitterly complaining and a lot of suffering, the interist finally put me on Gabapentin, then switched me to Lyrica, which I can't afford inspite of insurance, and back to Gabapentin.  I saw a Pain Management guy, couldn't help it, but I just didn't like him very much.  My Medicare HMO had only this one on their approved list.  He suggested nerve block into the costalbrachial....somethingsomething, it sounded frightening and I chickened out.  The interenist, whom I trust, wasn't all that gung-ho about it either.  On top of it all, neuropathy I got in both feet and hands from Taxol is now getting so bad, it's all the way up the left leg to the knee, can hardly walk - oh, I am alive allright, just sometimes wonder if I want to be!  I know you had a number of nerve blocks done and had to have them repeatedly, if I rememer right (I always folllow your blogs).  Would you still have them and did they last for any length of time?  Were they painful?  I undeerstand they can't be done in the doctor's office, but have to be performed in day surgery.  Your comments would be so very much appreciated."

40342,"Hi Friends,
As luck would have it, my realization that something is wrong is happening 2 days before Christmas. And so, I am seeking guidance during this lag period, while I wait to take action.
My situation is lymph node swelling. The ones above my breast, under my arm, under my breast. I think i feel something IN one of the nodes under my arm.  I've had quite a lot of discomfort for months, where my left arm suddenly feels weak and achy, like I have an impingement. Only a month ago did I link it to my lymph nodes. Even then, I wasn't alarmed. I was given basic training (years ago) by a homeopath to drain lymph nodes, and so I began doing so, started detoxing through diet, etc. I still am hopeful it is as simple as fluid retention after having a couple viruses. But my gut says something is wrong, and action is needed now.
  The question I'd like to ask is where to begin. I like to know exactly what to ask the doctor when I go in, exactly what tests to request (in case my Dr. misses something).
I've read that biopsy is the difinitive diagnostic procedure, but I'm guessing we don't start there. Do I start with mammogram to rule out breast involvement? Get an ultrasound of my nodes? With 3 kids, I'd frankly like to cut to the chase, with as few tests and babysitters as possible.
Thanks for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.

The NP is everything the doctor isn't...except I've noticed that he doesn't do these two things."

I would put on my sisters white lipstick and white go-go boots and dance, lucky you-tube wasn't around then!  Of course, now I am shy about dancing.  But, anyway, i was thinking about this and i was alone in the house, so i put on some Earth, Wind and Fire (but no white boots or lipstick) and i was dancing like crazy, and it made me feel so good.  Music can take you out of a dark place, so when you are down, put on some funk and dance.  Or, think of one of your passions from when you were little and innocent and go with it.  Put on Groove Tonight or Boogie and your fingers will be snapping.  I love you guys"
44431,"Hi, my name is Christina and I am 30 years old. I was diagnosed with breast cancer back in October of last year. I started chemo the 1st of December. My doctor started me with Paclitaxel chemo, one dose every week. My last dose of Paclitaxel was on February 15th. I did very good on that type of chemo, meaning I had no nausea or vomiting! I did lose my hair and have had very severe itchness on my hands and feet. To the point that I can't walk, drive or anything but scratch. Has anyone else had this issue?? My hands and arms look like I have chicken pox! "

44828,My little sister was just diagnosed with Stage 0 cacinoma in-situ. I am so upset and somehow feeling weirdly guilty. I thank God it was caught early like this and have assured her she will make a full recovery. I can't help but wonder about so many women who get mets with early cancers like this though. Mine was advanced Stage 2 Her2 pos so a very different illness. My sister will get surgery and some rads only as she didn't want to accept the option of waiting to see. She says I might have saved her life since she is now so diligent with her mammograms and also that she chose to proceed to treatment right away. She is also getting genetic testing that was not needed for me since I was the first to get bc. I worry for my other two sisters and daughter. Difficult times....Anna

Evidently she didn't realize this was blood work ordered by my oncologist as it seems my tumor markers were way elevated. (7. something)
I had been concerned about a muscle spasm in my right back and hoped it wouldn't light up like Times Square on the scan. I'd had this problem since early April and I thought it was from my new keyboard.
After getting the results yesterday I now know what I'm facing and it's not good. Evidently I have 2 spots on my spine (T2 and T9) as well as mets to the 12th rib. So the pain wasn't a muscle spasm at all but bone mets.
I was to have my port installed yesterday morning but the imaging machine at the hospital went on the fritz and I've still heard nothing about rescheduling.
I will be starting 6 rounds of CMF (Cytoxan, Methotrexate and Fluorouracil) probably next week. Not sure what the prognosis is for the bone mets but I've heard not so good.
Anyone else dealt with this?

45921,"Curiously I am wondering how many woman waited for their diagnosis, due to doctor failing to order additional diagnostic tests needed, to rule out breast cancer or any cancer. How many mammograms did you have before your diagnoses? Stage 0 and stage 3 is the difference between fighting off cancer and fighting for your life. DO you have a horror story or complaint? Contact me please"
45938,"So,  I skipped mammograms for 5 yrs. Prior history of 15 yrs of  mammos was uneventful for me, minus one guided needel aspiration-diagnosed as a cyst- 6 yrs ago. Among over 50 family members, a maternal aunt had brst cancer in her early 40's, and subsequently passed away.  :-(   I think my risks are low of having any cancer. Altho, I was not pregnant / give birth until my early 30's, I think I reduced my risks by brstfeeding for over 5 yrs. total. So, I skippped those 5 yrs, of mammos, confidently. Also, after seeing what my aunt went through, I thought I would not treat cancer if I did have it.  (she had it 30 yrs ago. )  The eason for this topic, is that I had a screening mammo, was called back for diagnostic mammo on rt, ultra sound on left, which resulted in an ultrasound on rt also. I was informed I have heterogenously dense brsts, and lots of calcifications. FOllow-up in 3 mos, and an MRI are recommended. I don't have the reprot yet, Info came from the US tech, via the radiologist. I feel they r either looking for something, or that my finally agreeing to a screening mammo, has simply lead to ongoing tests, due to dense brsts. I don't know whether to be annoyed or concerned. Anyone have a similar experience? I have been reading a lot on the net, bout different types of calcifications. Back of my mind, tho, is that my family has heart disease, not cancer."

So about 3 weeks ago found a lump in my breast.  yep, the beast rears it's ugly head again.  Right now I'm stage 2.  I'm going for a PET scan tomorrow.  Guess they are trying to see if it is anywhere else and if it is a new cancer or metastisized from colon.  At this point I want a lumpectomy if we can.  Have to see if Tomixfen will shrink the tumor then we will start that.  When I read about the chemo it says not much effects.  I'm hoping.  The rounds of chemo really made me sick with the colon cancer and I would like to work through this chemo.  I have two jobs just to get by and can't afford to not work the second part time job.  UGH.  Just wanted to post.  Hard to talk to family because they are so upset.  I have 4 wonderful children that helped get me through the first cancer.  Hated telling them I had it again.  I now have a wonderful new guy friend.  My husband asked for a divorce almost a year after my first chemo.  Both parents died since I got cancer.  One was from prostrate cancer so I know it from the survivor side and the caregiver.  I always think of the people here that I met and helped me through it.  Guess I'm reaching out again to people that understand and don't judge.  I want to send hugs to everyone here as I write this.  "

So I have an appt next week with the gastroenterologist for an evaluation and then I'll get a colonoscopy. My regular doctor tells me not to worry yet as that hot spot can mean another illness not just cancer, but I can't stop thinking what if it is cancer again what if I have to go through all of that again? What if I die this time, I don't want to leave my kids alone they are too small they need their mother! Maybe I'm just overeacting but I can't help it I can't stop thinking about it. "

48458,"Saw pain dr. Am on 100mcg Fentanyl patch now.  Helps the pain, but waiting for head to get use to it.  Hands are numb most of the time and pain in neck and shoulders increased.  I thought hands were from neuropathy, after phys exam, she says most likely tumor activity in c-spine and clavical.  Ref me to rad onco. Both pain and rads onco are with my old cancer center, and are covered under my secondary after medicare pays.  New med onco is not covered and he wants all scans/tests to go thru University (where he is in the bc center at the cancer research hospital affiliated with the U) which is out of network for my ins.
He goes b tumor markers and 8weeks ago said tumors are stable, but a week later, I was at ER for pain in left leg. When I put weight on it, pain shot from calf to hip.  Inthought clot, er doc thought fracture, ultra sound ruled out clot, xray showed new tumor activity in calf/knee.
Now , if increased pain and numbness is more tumor activity, then I would say I am most likely not stable, which means my last treatment/hope -- Aromasin is not working, even if markers were down.
My old onco did not use markers as he didnt think they were as accurate as how the patient was feeling combined with scans.... so what keeps going thru my head is that most likely I have failed with my last option (hope going back down), and this scares me.  Yet, if I hadnt gone to this onco, I would have been out of options over a year ago.
That brings me to the radiation.  I know how much it has helped me previously, but that was not on my neck which could mess with my swollowing, voicebox, or as offered prev. on oral radiation that would he systemic.
My mind is just a mumble jumble right now.
Does anyone have any input?  Wish this brain had an on/off switch.

48495,"I'm new to this board, new to cancer, just diagnosed this year with stage 4 breast cancer.  I've never had any symptoms, other than a lump.  First medical provider did lumpectomy but then the oncologist told me they wouldn't do chemo because I was stage 4.  I changed medical providers and have just finished 19 weeks of low-dose chemo with 5 more to go.  No parents or siblings.  Husband got angry and mean, so he's gone.  I have friends, they're sweet, but they don't understand.  I'm 53 and still raising three kids, 16, 13, 10.  I guess no one ever expects to get cancer, but I never expected to have to do this alone.  Just scared . . . and alone.  Suggestions?  Resourses?  Anyone in the Pacific Northwest?"

I never even got to have any fills.  I was told that I could revisit recon at a later date.  My priority has been getting through chemo, (less than half way done). My problem seems to be that everyone, including all my doctors seem to think that I should start reconstruction again as soon as my chemo is done.  They make me feel ugly! What is the matter with me staying like this.  Yes, I am very aware that the feminine form is usually a lot more curvy than mine, I can wear my prothesesis when I chose to, I find them heavy and not too comfortable. My husband seems to feel the same as the doctors and I'm beginning to feel that my breasts are for everyone but me.  I should mention that I am 55 years young and in otherwise excellent health.

49180,"1 big lumpectomy, 2nd surgery to get clean margins, 3rd surgery breast oncoplasty so I don't look lopsided the rest of my life. 51 years old, 3 kids, 28 years married to a wonderful man. Happy, Christian, and I found this damn cancer myself after exercising one day. I had begun a strict weight loss program and had just lost 30 lbs in 4 month."
49264,"Last year I have my right breast removed and a tissue expander put in at the same time. All went well until a few weeks before I was scheduled to have the expander removed and the actual implant inserted. I developed redness on the lower side of my breast.  My breast was warm to the touch, but I had no fever nor did I have any pain.  PS sent me to an infectious disease doctor who said the only way to determine if infection was present was to remove expander and send it out for testing. This was done and everythign came back as no infection.  We waited until everything healed and then two weeks ago, an expander was again inserted. I now have redness again at the same location, no warmth this time, no pain and no fever. PS is baffled as to where we go from here. Has this happened to anyone else?"
49343,"As I posted previously, my mother, an active 80 year old, was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of her right breast.  She had a PET/CT done and we just got the report yesterday.   At first we thought it was just in the right breast with one lymph node, but the scan revealed a mass in both of her lungs, albiet small, but PET active.  The one nodule was 7 mm (SUV 3.8) and the other 9 mm (SUV 4.6).  The lymph node had an SUV of 4.0 and I didn't ask about the original tumor.   Because of the lung nodules, they are now classifying her as a Stage IV."

49423,"Hi my name is cat(Cathy).  I am new here.  I was the second of three sisters who were all diagnosed with breast cancer this year.  I am 48 and the youngest.  I have invasive ductile carcinoma of the right breast.  My sister Judy(59) was diagnosed first and was halfway through chemo when they found mine.  I just went for my yearly not thinking they would find it in me to.  She has the same cancer as me but it was a little larger, 2cm to my .8cm. She is also triple neg.   I am HER2pos and estrogen pos(only10%).  My sister Terri(53) was nervous at this point and went for her mamo six month early. She has lobular cancer.  It was a little bigger than 2cm. And she is the only one with node involvement.  It was in one node.  We are all having slightly different treatment.  Terri and I share a Dr.  "
